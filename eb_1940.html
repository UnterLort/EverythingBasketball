                <h3>Who Invented Basketball?</h3>
                <p>
                    Dr. James Naismith is the person responsible for creating the game of Basketball. While working for
                    the YMCA in the early 1890s, Naismith was tasked in developing a new game. When tasked in developing
                    a new game, Naismith referred to a game from his childhood called "Duck on a Rock".
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Where Did the Idea Come From?</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1891, Naismith was tasked in introducing a new indoor game with the two primary objectives of
                    making it fair for all players, and free of rough play. Naismith would analyze the games of the day,
                    which included Rugby, Lacrosse, Football, Soccer, Hockey, and Baseball. While observing these games,
                    Naismith also took note of how larger balls didn't move as swift as the smaller balls, so he would
                    end up choosing a Soccer ball for the new game. Naismith also noticed that contact and rough play
                    during the other games would occur when the object was carried, dribbled, stick handled, etc.
                    Naismith first action in the development of his new game was to remove running with the ball.
                    Naismith also took note of how there was too much jostling and rough play in the defense of the
                    goal, net or goal line during the other games. So Naismith then decided to place the goal above the
                    plane of the playing area. But this also raised the question of how the players would shoot and
                    score. Naismith would incorporate the lobbed arcing shot, due to how successful it was in "Duck on a
                    Rock". Naismith would take this lobbed arcing shot and would incorporate it into the shooting method
                    for his new game called Basket Ball.

                <h3>What Was the First Official Game of Basketball?</h3>
                <p>The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20,
                    1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1-0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a
                    court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA)
                    court.</p>

                <h3>The Foundation of the NBA</h3>
                <p>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams
                    in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional
                    game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls.
                    Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African
                    American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still existing) Harlem
                    Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours. In 1946, the
                    Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged
                    with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By
                    the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of
                    interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in
                    Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great
                    players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of
                    the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in
                    basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and
                    briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.</p>

                <h3>What Was the First Offical Game in the NBA?</h3>
                <p>On November 1, 1946, the first NBA (at the time called the BAA) basketball game took place in
                    Toronto, Canada. The game was between The New York Knicks and the Toronto Huskies at Maple Leaf
                    Gardens and drew in over 7000 spectators, most who knew very little about basketball; The Knicks
                    won 68-66.</p>

                <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                <p>The original basketball was made using a stitched leather shell stuffed with rubber, and the
                    origianl hoop was made using a straw peach basket held together by wooden rings.</p>
