                    <p>
                        Dr. James Naismith is the person responsible for creating the game of Basketball. While working for the YMCA in the early 1890s, Naismith was tasked in developing a new game. When tasked in developing a new game, Naismith referred to a game from his childhood called "Duck on a Rock".

                    <h4 class="header-text">Where Did the Idea Come From?</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        In 1891, Naismith was tasked in introducing a new indoor game with the two primary objectives of making it fair for all players, and free of rough play. Naismith would analyze the games of the day, which included Rugby, Lacrosse, Football, Soccer, Hockey, and Baseball. While observing these games, Naismith also took note of how larger balls didn't move as swift as the smaller balls, so he would end up choosing a Soccer ball for the new game. Naismith also noticed that contact and rough play during the other games would occur when the object was carried, dribbled, stick handled, etc. Naismith first action in the development of his new game was to remove running with the ball. Naismith also took note of how there was too much jostling and rough play in the defense of the goal, net or goal line during the other games. So Naismith then decided to place the goal above the plane of the playing area. But this also raised the question of how the players would shoot and score. Naismith would incorporate the lobbed arcing shot, due to how successful it was in "Duck on a Rock". Naismith would take this lobbed arcing shot and would incorporate it into the shooting method for his new game called Basket Ball.

                        <p>The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.</p>

                        <p>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours. In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.</p>

The game was between The New York Knicks and the Toronto Huskies at Maple Leaf Gardens and drew in over 7000 spectators, most who knew very little about basketball; The Knicks won 68-66.</p>
