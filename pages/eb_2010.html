                <h3>A New Era</h3>
                <p>
                    When the 3-point line was introduced at the very end of 1979, it took a decently long time for players to adapt to taking the risk for an extra couple points. However, as basketball continued to revolve around large men who excelled at long shots, the rate at which players would try a 3-point shot since 1980 has increased by 39.2%. You see basically everyone in the NBA score tons of 3-pointers now, and it's why you see kids on local basketball courts try for these impossibly long shots to be like there heroes on TV.

                <h3>Best 3-Point Shooters in the NBA</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the first players that popularized shooting from the 3-point line <b>AND</b> managed to consistently score from it was Steve Kerr from the Golden State Warriors. Although his team wasn't particularly notable when he joined, Steve would make good use of his teammates by prioritizing a triangular offense. He led his team to consecutively beating the Houston Rockets 14 times, became coach rookie winningest coach in the history of the NBA, attempted 1,599 3-pointer throughout his carrer, a 3-point shooting percentage of 0.454, and ended with one of the best regular seasons and one of the best teams in NBA history with 67 wins and only 15 loses. However, a new successor to his legacy soon came along. That man was Stephen Curry. While Steve Kerr could just consistently shoot from the 3-point line, Steph almost <b>never</b> missed a shot, scoring 2,977 3-point shots and counting, as well as having a 3-point shooting percentage of 0.4275. He was also awarded the first ever unanimous MVP award in 2015, and won 3 NBA championships during the 2010s. Another player who joined the Golden State Warriors was Klay Thompson, who's offensive stradegy was often quite literally to just gaurd the 3-point line and shoot the ball when it was passed to him. As unorthodox as it was, it was quite effective, and he won 3 championships with his team throughout his time in the 2010s, as well as having a 3-point shooting percentage of 0.4161. Then of course, there's the king of the court, LeBron James from the Miami Heat. He became a very well-known player, especially throughout the 2010s. While he wasn't as known for 3-pointers as some of the others on the list, he still scored a total of 2,261 3-point shots and counting, has a 3-point shooting percentage of 0.345, and won 3 NBA championships during the 2010s.
