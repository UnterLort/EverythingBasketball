                <h3>The 2000s</h3>
                <p>
                    The NBA in the 2000s was one of the most exciting and impactful eras in NBA history. This decade is widely known for being the beginning of LeBron James' career, as LeBron was drafted in the 2003 NBA Draft. Before LeBron came into the league, the 2000s was known to be dominated by a number of NBA legends. To start the 2000s, the Los Angeles Lakers, who were led by their Hall Of Fame duo, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal had won the previous <strong>3</strong> straight championships (00, 01, 02). Shaquille O'Neal would be named the league MVP in the 1999-00 season as he put up strong averages of <strong>29.7</strong> points, <strong>13.6</strong> rebounds, <strong>3.8</strong> assists, <strong>0.5</strong> steals, and <strong>3.0</strong> blocks on a league leading <strong>57.4%</strong> from the field. Shaq's <strong>29.7</strong> points per game average would lead the league in points per game and Shaq would also win the scoring title this year as he scored a total of <strong>2344</strong> points. Shaq's duo partner Kobe Bryant also had a noteworthy season as he averaged <strong>22.5</strong> points, <strong>6.3</strong> rebounds, <strong>4.9</strong> assists, <strong>1.6</strong> steals, and <strong>0.9</strong> blocks on <strong>46.8%</strong> from the field. Heading into the playoffs that season, they were set to verse the uprising team and future rival, the <strong>44-38</strong> Sacramento Kings who were led by future Hall Of Famers Chris Webber and Vlade Divac and superstar Peja Stojakovic, and their star point guard Jason Williams. This Kings team would push the Lakers to 5 games before being eliminated. In the second round, the Lakers were set to verse the <strong>53-29</strong> Phoenix Suns who were led by Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway (a former teammate of Shaquille O'Neal), Clifford Robinson, and a young and upcoming Jason Kidd and Shawn Marion, to also go along with veteran guard Kevin Johnson. The Lakers would handle this Phoenix team <strong>4-1</strong> as they now entered into the Conference Finals. In the Conference Finals, the Lakers were set to verse the <strong>59-23</strong> Portland TrailBlazers, who were led by Rasheed Wallace, Steve Smith, Arvydas Sabonis, Damon Stoudamire, to go along with a young and rising star in Jermaine O'Neal and veteran wing Scottie Pippen. This Blazers group gave the Lakers the toughest series they had all post-season as they pushed the Lakers to 7 games. However, the Lakers would prevail, winning the 7th game and earning their spot in the NBA Finals. Waiting for them in the NBA Finals was the <strong>56-26</strong> Indiana Pacers who led by future Hall Of Fame shooting guards, Reggie Miller and Chris Mullin, to go along with veteran point guard Mark Jackson, a talented small forward in Jalen Rose, and reliable center Rik Smits. However, these Pacers weren't prepared to deal with the force that was Shaquille O'Neal as he averaged <strong>38.0</strong> points, <strong>16.7</strong> rebounds, <strong>2.3</strong> assists, <strong>1.0</strong> steal, and <strong>2.7</strong> blocks. Kobe's contributions of <strong>15.6</strong> points, <strong>4.6</strong> rebounds, <strong>4.2</strong> assists, <strong>1.0</strong> steal, and <strong>1.4</strong> blocks. Other notable contributions came from the veteran guard, Ron Harper, the veteran small forward Glen Rice, the 29 year old Robert Horry, the 30 year old Rick Fox, and the 25 year old Derek Fisher. With the star power combined with a deep bench of players, the Lakers were able to close out the series in 6 games, winning their first of 3 straight NBA Championships.

                <h3>The Lakers 2001-2002 Run</h3>
                <p>
                    The 2001-02 Lakers would breeze through the regular season with a <strong>58-24</strong> record, which tied them for second best in the whole league. Having kept practically the same roster from the 1999-00 season, the Lakers were set for yet another Champhionship run. They began by sweeping the Portland TrailBlazers in the first round. They then ran into the talented <strong>58-24</strong> San Antonio Spurs, who had an amazing roster, consisting of the future Hall Of Fame frontcourt duo of Tim Duncan and David Robinson, to go along with future Hall Of Fame point guard Tony Parker, and the talented lockdown small forward Bruce Bowen. However, the Lakers were able to handle the spurs in 5 games. On to the conference finals now, and they were set to verse their rivals, the Sacramento Kings. This series is known for having some controversy surrounding it as there has been evidence that game 6 (specifically in the 4th quarter) of the series was rigged in order to keep the Lakers in the series, as they were trailing 3-2 at that point. With the series now tied 3-3, the deciding 7th game was to take place in the home arena of the Sacramento Kings. However, the Kings were not able to close out the series and the Lakers prevailed as they now secured their spot in the NBA Finals. Waiting for them in the NBA Finals was the <strong>52-30</strong> New Jersey Nets, who were led by future Hall Of Fame point guard Jason Kidd, to go along with the talented rookie small forward Richard Jefferson, future All-Star power forward Kenyon Martin, the talented small forward Keith Van Horn, and the talented shooting guard Kerry Kittles.
