                <h3>The 2000s</h3>
                <p>
                    The NBA in the 2000s was one of the most exciting and impactful eras in NBA history. This decade is widely known for being the beginning of LeBron James' career, as LeBron was drafted in the 2003 NBA Draft. Before LeBron came into the league, the 2000s was known to be dominated by a number of NBA legends. To start the 2000s, the Los Angeles Lakers, who were led by their Hall Of Fame duo, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal had won the previous <strong>3</strong> straight championships (00, 01, 02). Shaquille O'Neal would be named the league MVP in the 1999-00 season as he put up strong averages of <strong>29.7</strong> points, <strong>13.6</strong> rebounds, <strong>3.8</strong> assists, <strong>0.5</strong> steals, and <strong>3.0</strong> blocks on a league leading <strong>57.4%</strong> from the field. Shaq's <strong>29.7</strong> points per game average would lead the league in points per game and Shaq would also win the scoring title this year as he scored a total of <strong>2344</strong> points. Shaq's duo partner Kobe Bryant also had a noteworthy season as he averaged <strong>22.5</strong> points, <strong>6.3</strong> rebounds, <strong>4.9</strong> assists, <strong>1.6</strong> steals, and <strong>0.9</strong> blocks on <strong>46.8%</strong> from the field. Heading into the playoffs that season, they were set to verse the uprising team and future rival, the <strong>44-38</strong> Sacramento Kings who were led by future Hall Of Famers Chris Webber and Vlade Divac and superstar Peja Stojakovic, and their star point guard Jason Williams. This Kings team would push the Lakers to 5 games before being eliminated. In the second round, the Lakers were set to verse the <strong>53-29</strong> Phoenix Suns who were led by Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway (a former teammate of Shaquille O'Neal), Clifford Robinson, and a young and upcoming Jason Kidd and Shawn Marion, to also go along with veteran guard Kevin Johnson. The Lakers would handle this Phoenix team <strong>4-1</strong> as they now entered into the Conference Finals. In the Conference Finals, the Lakers were set to verse the <strong>59-23</strong> Portland TrailBlazers, who were led by Rasheed Wallace, Steve Smith, Arvydas Sabonis, Damon Stoudamire, to go along with a young and rising star in Jermaine O'Neal and veteran wing Scottie Pippen. This Blazers group gave the Lakers the toughest series they had all post-season as they pushed the Lakers to 7 games. However, the Lakers would prevail, winning the 7th game and earning their spot in the NBA Finals. Waiting for them in the NBA Finals was the <strong>56-26</strong> Indiana Pacers who led by future Hall Of Fame shooting guards, Reggie Miller and Chris Mullin, to go along with veteran point guard Mark Jackson, a talented small forward in Jalen Rose, and reliable center Rik Smits. However, these Pacers weren't prepared to deal with the force that was Shaquille O'Neal as he averaged <strong>38.0</strong> points, <strong>16.7</strong> rebounds, <strong>2.3</strong> assists, <strong>1.0</strong> steal, and <strong>2.7</strong> blocks.
