                <h3>Potential Future</h3>
                <p>
                    On July 1st, 2023, the NBA's new CBA (Collective Bargaining Argeement) will be initiated. Every 7 years, all the coaches and other league officials hold a conference to discuss the changes that should be made, with the goal of improving the NBA. The new CBA that was announced during the 2022-23 NBA season will run through the 2028-29 season, which will be the next time a new CBA will be announced. Until then, the rules and changes made in the CBA will take place during the seasons within that seven year stretch. On April 26, 2023, the NBA and NBPA (National Basketball Players Association) announced that the new CBA has been ratified by the NBA Board of Governors and the NBA Players. Topics that were covered within this new CBA included adjustments to the salary cap and luxury tax, free agency, contract extensions, trades, awards, and the NBA draft. The new CBA also has initiated some new concepts for the league which include an in-season tournament and miscellaneous. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting off with the salary cap and luxury tax adjustments. The Salary Cap is a figure that is determined based on league revenue which determines how much money teams are allowed to spend acquiring players through either trades or free agency from other teams without using salary-cap exceptions. A team below the line may spend freely in the free agent or trade markets until it reaches that line. A team above the line can only add salary through either the traded player exception or one of the exceptions. 
                    
                    The Luxury Tax is a team salary figure that, once passed, forces the offending team to pay a fine to the league that is then dispersed amongst the teams that stayed below the line. According to the new CBA, there will be a second "apron." An apron is a team salary figure that is typically around <strong>$6</strong> million above the tax line that under certain circumstances triggers a hard cap. 
                    
                    The Hard Cap is a team salary figure (which is set at the apron) in which, once triggered, cannot be crossed for any reason. There are a total of <strong>3</strong> ways that a hard cap can be triggered. The first is a team that uses the non-taxplayer mid-level exception (a cap exception that allows teams to sign one or multiple free agents to contracts above the minimum salary even if they are above the cap. There are three different mid-level exceptions. Teams may only use one of them, and the one(s) they have access to depends on their overall finances). 
                    
                    Those three different mid-level exceptions are the cap-room (an exception that is given to teams that were far enough below the cap to spend cap space on free agents. It can be used to sign contracts no longer than two years), the taxpayer (which can be used by any team operating above the salary cap, but is traditionally used by the most expensive ones. It offers a lower salary, but does not trigger a hard cap. It can be used to sign contracts no longer than three years), and the non-taxpayer (can be used by any team operating above the salary cap, but must be wielded with caution, as any team that does use it is hard-capped at the apron. It can be used to sign contracts for up to four years). The second way a hard cap is triggered is that a team uses the bi-annual exception (a cap exception that allows teams to sign a free agent to a contract above the minimum even if they are above the cap. This exception can be used only once every two years, and using it triggers a hard cap. Bi-annual contracts can last two years). And the third way is a team that acquires a player through a sign-and-trade (an agreement between a player, his original team and a new team in which the player re-signs with his original team only to be immediately traded to a new one. The acquiring team will then be subjected to a hard cap. The trade must meet the same salary-matching criteria that a typical trade would. The contract must be signed with the original team using either cap space or a cap exception).
                    
                    The new second apron initiated by the new CBA will come in at around <strong>$17.5</strong> million above the tax line, and it will trigger a host of restrictions. The main goal of those restrictions will be to make it harder for teams like the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors to spend significantly more money on talent than their competitors, however it should be noted that these restrictions will only make it harder for teams to acquire new, expensive players. None of these changes will make it harder to retain players that a team has drafted and developed, and only in a few, rare cases will it become more difficult for teams to retain free agents they've signed from other teams. The NBA wants teams to be able to keep their players. It is essentially a way to prevent the rich from getting richer. For the rich teams, the figures that govern how much they will actually pay in luxury taxes are rising slightly. In the past, the NBA used fixed tax brackets set <strong>$5</strong> million apart. If a team spent anywhere between <strong>$1 and $4,999,999</strong> above the tax line, they would owe an additional <strong>$1.50</strong> in luxury taxes for each dollar spent. Then, between <strong>$5 million and $10 million</strong>, that figure rose to <strong>$1.75</strong>. The tax grows more punitive the deeper a team goes, but it continues in those same <strong>$5 million</strong> increments forever. However, with the new CBA, that will be slightly changing. With the new CBA, the size of those brackets will increase every year by the same amount that the salary cap does. If the cap goes up by <strong>5%</strong>, the brackets will as well. This will effectively make it harder for teams to reach the highest, most punitive tax brackets, and in the process will lower their tax payments on a relative basis. When actually calculating the Salary Cap, the players were able to win one major concession from the ownership. The league's licensing revenue—which is projected to come in at around <strong>$160</strong> million next season—will now count as basketball-related income, allowing the players to share in that revenue. Based on that <strong>$160</strong> million projection, this new source of player revenue will boost the salary cap by at least <strong>$2</strong> million once instituted, and that figure is only likely to grow.

                    Also with the new CBA agreement, the growth of the cap will not be limitless. In 2016, a new television contract between the league and its national media partners (Disney and Turner) led to an influx of revenue that increased the salary cap by <strong>32%</strong>. This spike gave the Golden State Warriors the cap space they needed to sign Kevin Durant, but just as critically, it created an extremely uneven distribution of wealth within the league. Players who were lucky enough or prescient enough to become free agents in 2016 got enormous contracts because almost every team had the space to spend. However, players who became free agents later on in 2018 saw a barren market as the cap didn't spike again and the teams were still saddled with those enormous 2016 contracts. This will not happen again because both sides have agreed to institute cap smoothing. Under the terms of this agreement, the salary cap cannot increase by more than <strong>10%</strong> in any given year regardless of how much new revenue the league makes. If there is an excess, it will be tacked onto future seasons. The players will still get all of their money, but it won't come in the form of a short-term spike that alters that competitive balance of the league.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second "apron" mentioned above will come into play in Free Agency as it will place two significant free-agent restrictions on teams that come in above that line. The first restriction will be that the teams that are above the second apron cannot use the taxpayer mid-level exception to sign free agents. That exception is the only tool tax teams currently have to pay free agents above the minimum salary (a player salary figure that determines the lowest amount he can be paid). Such contracts could last up to three seasons, and this year, they could pay as much as <strong>$6,479,000</strong> in starting salary. This rule would have prevented four free-agent signings in the 2022 offseason: Danilo Gallinari to the Boston Celtics, Donte DiVincenzo to the Golden State Warriors, Joe Ingles to the Milwaukee Bucks and John Wall to the Los Angeles Clippers. Since the NBA's most expensive teams rely on the minimum contract signings to fill out the remaining slots available on their roster, most of those minimum contracts usually last for one year, which then means that those teams only have Non-Birds on that player in free agency in the following offseason. This means that if a team wants to keep them without using a cap exception, they can only offer a <strong>20%</strong> raise on the player's prior, minimum salary. Players that teams want to keep more often than not outperform for what they signed for, especially since veterans typically use minimum deals on good teams as opportunities to showcase themselves for potential future deals. The workaround for these teams used to be the taxpayer mid-level exception. It allowed them to retain their minimum-salary successes by giving them a reasonable raise. However, without the taxpayer mid-level exception at their disposal, these teams are likely going to lose their best minimum-salary players after only a single year. The second restriction will be that teams that are above the second apron cannot sign players on the buyout market. The exact definition of "buyout market" has yet to be revealed, but it will likely apply to any player who is traded and waived during the season or waived while sacrificing a portion of his salary.

                    With the new CBA, for the first time, the taxpayer mid-level exception will trigger a hard cap. The original hard cap limits teams to the first apron, but now, the taxpayer mid-level exception will limit teams to the second. This is crucial
