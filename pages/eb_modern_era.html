                <h3>Potential Future</h3>
                <p>
                    On July 1st, 2023, the NBA's new CBA (Collective Bargaining Argeement) will be initiated. Every 7 years, all the coaches and other league officials hold a conference to discuss the changes that should be made, with the goal of improving the NBA. The new CBA that was announced during the 2022-23 NBA season will run through the 2028-29 season, which will be the next time a new CBA will be announced. Until then, the rules and changes made in the CBA will take place during the seasons within that seven year stretch. On April 26, 2023, the NBA and NBPA (National Basketball Players Association) announced that the new CBA has been ratified by the NBA Board of Governors and the NBA Players. Topics that were covered within this new CBA included adjustments to the salary cap and luxury tax, free agency, contract extensions, trades, awards, and the NBA draft. The new CBA also has initiated some new concepts for the league which include an in-season tournament and miscellaneous.

                <h3>Salary Cap and Luxury Tax Adjustments</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting off with the salary cap and luxury tax adjustments. The Salary Cap is a figure that is determined based on league revenue which determines how much money teams are allowed to spend acquiring players through either trades or free agency from other teams without using salary-cap exceptions. A team below the line may spend freely in the free agent or trade markets until it reaches that line. A team above the line can only add salary through either the traded player exception or one of the exceptions. 
                    
                    The Luxury Tax is a team salary figure that, once passed, forces the offending team to pay a fine to the league that is then dispersed amongst the teams that stayed below the line. According to the new CBA, there will be a second "apron." An apron is a team salary figure that is typically around <strong>$6</strong> million above the tax line that under certain circumstances triggers a hard cap. 
                    
                    The Hard Cap is a team salary figure (which is set at the apron) in which, once triggered, cannot be crossed for any reason. There are a total of <strong>3</strong> ways that a hard cap can be triggered. The first is a team that uses the non-taxpayer mid-level exception (a cap exception that allows teams to sign one or multiple free agents to contracts above the minimum salary even if they are above the cap. There are three different mid-level exceptions. Teams may only use one of them, and the one(s) they have access to depends on their overall finances). 
                    
                    Those three different mid-level exceptions are the cap-room (an exception that is given to teams that were far enough below the cap to spend cap space on free agents. It can be used to sign contracts no longer than two years), the taxpayer (which can be used by any team operating above the salary cap, but is traditionally used by the most expensive ones. It offers a lower salary, but does not trigger a hard cap. It can be used to sign contracts no longer than three years), and the non-taxpayer (can be used by any team operating above the salary cap, but must be wielded with caution, as any team that does use it is hard-capped at the apron. It can be used to sign contracts for up to four years). The second way a hard cap is triggered is that a team uses the bi-annual exception (a cap exception that allows teams to sign a free agent to a contract above the minimum even if they are above the cap. This exception can be used only once every two years, and using it triggers a hard cap. Bi-annual contracts can last two years). And the third way is a team that acquires a player through a sign-and-trade (an agreement between a player, his original team and a new team in which the player re-signs with his original team only to be immediately traded to a new one. The acquiring team will then be subjected to a hard cap. The trade must meet the same salary-matching criteria that a typical trade would. The contract must be signed with the original team using either cap space or a cap exception).
                    
                    The new second apron initiated by the new CBA will come in at around <strong>$17.5</strong> million above the tax line, and it will trigger a host of restrictions. The main goal of those restrictions will be to make it harder for teams like the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors to spend significantly more money on talent than their competitors, however it should be noted that these restrictions will only make it harder for teams to acquire new, expensive players. None of these changes will make it harder to retain players that a team has drafted and developed, and only in a few, rare cases will it become more difficult for teams to retain free agents they've signed from other teams. The NBA wants teams to be able to keep their players. It is essentially a way to prevent the rich from getting richer. For the rich teams, the figures that govern how much they will actually pay in luxury taxes are rising slightly. In the past, the NBA used fixed tax brackets set <strong>$5</strong> million apart. If a team spent anywhere between <strong>$1 and $4,999,999</strong> above the tax line, they would owe an additional <strong>$1.50</strong> in luxury taxes for each dollar spent. Then, between <strong>$5 million and $10 million</strong>, that figure rose to <strong>$1.75</strong>. The tax grows more punitive the deeper a team goes, but it continues in those same <strong>$5 million</strong> increments forever. However, with the new CBA, that will be slightly changing. With the new CBA, the size of those brackets will increase every year by the same amount that the salary cap does. If the cap goes up by <strong>5%</strong>, the brackets will as well. This will effectively make it harder for teams to reach the highest, most punitive tax brackets, and in the process will lower their tax payments on a relative basis. When actually calculating the Salary Cap, the players were able to win one major concession from the ownership. The league's licensing revenue—which is projected to come in at around <strong>$160</strong> million next season—will now count as basketball-related income, allowing the players to share in that revenue. Based on that <strong>$160</strong> million projection, this new source of player revenue will boost the salary cap by at least <strong>$2</strong> million once instituted, and that figure is only likely to grow.

                    Also with the new CBA agreement, the growth of the cap will not be limitless. In 2016, a new television contract between the league and its national media partners (Disney and Turner) led to an influx of revenue that increased the salary cap by <strong>32%</strong>. This spike gave the Golden State Warriors the cap space they needed to sign Kevin Durant, but just as critically, it created an extremely uneven distribution of wealth within the league. Players who were lucky enough or prescient enough to become free agents in 2016 got enormous contracts because almost every team had the space to spend. However, players who became free agents later on in 2018 saw a barren market as the cap didn't spike again and the teams were still saddled with those enormous 2016 contracts. This will not happen again because both sides have agreed to institute cap smoothing. Under the terms of this agreement, the salary cap cannot increase by more than <strong>10%</strong> in any given year regardless of how much new revenue the league makes. If there is an excess, it will be tacked onto future seasons. The players will still get all of their money, but it won't come in the form of a short-term spike that alters that competitive balance of the league.

                <h3>Free Agency Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    The second "apron" mentioned above will come into play in Free Agency as it will place two significant free-agent restrictions on teams that come in above that line. The first restriction will be that the teams that are above the second apron cannot use the taxpayer mid-level exception to sign free agents. That exception is the only tool tax teams currently have to pay free agents above the minimum salary (a player salary figure that determines the lowest amount he can be paid). Such contracts could last up to three seasons, and this year, they could pay as much as <strong>$6,479,000</strong> in starting salary. This rule would have prevented four free-agent signings in the 2022 offseason: Danilo Gallinari to the Boston Celtics, Donte DiVincenzo to the Golden State Warriors, Joe Ingles to the Milwaukee Bucks and John Wall to the Los Angeles Clippers. Since the NBA's most expensive teams rely on the minimum contract signings to fill out the remaining slots available on their roster, most of those minimum contracts usually last for one year, which then means that those teams only have Non-Birds on that player in free agency in the following offseason. This means that if a team wants to keep them without using a cap exception, they can only offer a <strong>20%</strong> raise on the player's prior, minimum salary. Players that teams want to keep more often than not outperform for what they signed for, especially since veterans typically use minimum deals on good teams as opportunities to showcase themselves for potential future deals. The workaround for these teams used to be the taxpayer mid-level exception. It allowed them to retain their minimum-salary successes by giving them a reasonable raise. However, without the taxpayer mid-level exception at their disposal, these teams are likely going to lose their best minimum-salary players after only a single year. The second restriction will be that teams that are above the second apron cannot sign players on the buyout market. The exact definition of "buyout market" has yet to be revealed, but it will likely apply to any player who is traded and waived during the season or waived while sacrificing a portion of his salary.

                    With the new CBA, for the first time, the taxpayer mid-level exception will trigger a hard cap. The original hard cap limits teams to the first apron, but now, the taxpayer mid-level exception will limit teams to the second. This is crucial because these exceptions are largely used in the offseason, and can therefore affect a team's ability to make trades or sign free agents during the season. As an example, the Dallas Mavericks used their taxpayer mid-level exception on JaVale McGee in the offseason. This would have triggered a hard cap at the second apron figure. However, the Mavericks crossed that second apron figure at the deadline when they added roughly <strong>$8</strong> million in salary by trading for Kyrie Irving. Had this rule been in effect at the time, the Irving trade would not have been legal.

                    In order to balance out the restrictions in spending applied to the most expensive teams, the NBA has loosened spending amongst its other teams. The important thing to note down here is that this means significant increases in the two other mid-level exceptions. The first is the non-taxpayer mid-level exception will be increased by <strong>7.5%</strong>. During this season (2022-23), the maximum starting salary on a non-taxpayer mid-level contract was <strong>$10,490,000</strong>. The second is the cap room mid-level exception, which is provided to teams that operate below the cap, will now be increased by a serious increment at <strong>30%</strong>. During the 2022-23 NBA season, the maximum starting salary on a non-taxpayer mid-level contract was <strong>$5,401,000</strong>. Teams will now have more money to throw at starter-level players with the full mid-level exception, and the enhanced cap room exception will give teams an extra path to depth if they carve out a bunch of space to go after high value players.

                    The new CBA outlines one significant change that will affect all 30 teams. The 2017 CBA introduced the concept of two-way players, who split time between the NBA and G-League. Up to this point, teams have been allowed to have two of them at a time. With this new CBA, that amount is being increased to three. Owners looking to save money have frequently carried only 14 players with standard, NBA contracts on their roster for parts of the season knowing that cheaper two-way players can fill in when necessary. However, with now three slots being available, that temptation for saving money is expected to only grow stronger. The NBA still prohibit the teams from having two-way players active for more than 90 combined games in a season, however with three slots now becoming available, teams now will be able to cycle through two-way players who can now remain active for more than 90 combined games in a season. The three available slots will also give teams the ability to cycle through two-way players and test and or experiment more with the ones they like, which could potentially steer them away from signing more expensive veterans to deals.

                    The last thing the new CBA brings to the table for free agency is the response for matching offer sheets to free agents. For the original teams of a free agent, they will still be given the option to match any offer sheet that they sign within 48 hours, but now that timing to match the offer is now going to be reduced to 24 hours. To go along with that, the qualifying offer that teams are forced to make their own restricted free agents in order to retain their rights are getting a <strong>10%</strong> increase.

            <div>
                <h3>Contract Extension Adjustments</h3>
                <p>
                    The new CBA introduced a change that may one day be known as "The Jaylen Brown Rule." Under the old collective bargaining agreement, most veterans could only sign extensions that increased their salary by <strong>20%</strong> in the first season of the new deal. This has unfairly punished teams for signing players to contracts that were below market value, and Brown was the highest-profile example. Due to this <strong>20%</strong> limitation, it has prevented the Boston Celtics from extending Brown at his maximum salary. Brown is a player that is constantly performing at a max-caliber level, but this restriction would have virtually guaranteed that Brown would become an unrestricted free agent in 2024. In order for the Celtics to extend Brown's contract early, Brown would have had to earn All-NBA honors, which would then qualify him for a supermax extension. But now with this new CBA, the <strong>20%</strong> mark has now been increased to <strong>40%</strong>. This increase is enough to take Brown to his extended max, which will now give the Celtics the freedom to offer him what he is worth.

                    A far more inclusive change made in the new CBA is that now all rookie-scale extensions can now last five years. The Rookie extensions refer to the deals that are signed by former first-round picks with either the team that drafted them or the team that traded for them during their rookie deal, and in the past, only deals that paid those players their maximum salary could last five years. This saw a couple of slower-developing youngsters reaching the free agency market earlier than their teams would have liked. For example, the Charlotte Hornets lost their All-Star Kemba Walker in 2019, when this rule would have actually allowed the franchise to keep him for an extra year. And even though the Milwaukee Bucks had re-signed Giannis Antetokounmpo to a supermax deal in 2020, they had to stress about his possible exit from the team, as he was a non-max player at that point of his rookie extension, as he signed a four-year deal.

                <h3>Trade Changes</h3>

                    The second apron will also come into play for trade adjustemnts as well. The teams that are above the second apron will face the three trade limitations. The first limitation is that teams cannot send out cash in trade deals. Teams are ordinarily allowed to include a certain amount of cash in trades per season, with the 2022-23 season's figuring coming in at around <strong>$6</strong> million. Teams frequently use this tool when they make unbalanced trades or need another team to take on a player to clear a roster spot. The second limitation is that teams cannot trade first-round picks that are more than six years into the future. The NBA allows teams to trade draft picks up to seven years into the future, but that last season will be restricted to these teams. The third and last limitation is that now teams cannot make trades in which they take back more salary than they send out. The key takeaway here is that it is now going to be significantly harder for teams to trade for a second or even a third superstar caliber player.

                <h3>Award Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    As stated previously, the new CBA is now initiating a 65-games played requirement in order to be eligible for major individual awards like the MVP, Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY), which also includes All-NBA selections. Due to the growing tactic of load management (resting players, even if they don't have an injury), the league has obviously made this new requirement in hopes to discourage load management league-wide. But with this 65-games played requirement, it is going to make small, and even potentially random groups of players way more expensive. This is due to the fact that supermax eligibility is directly tied with individual awards. Last season (2021-22), four players made an All-NBA team, despite the fact of them playing fewer than 65 games, and two or more players made their way on the list at exactly 65 games played. This number might increase this season, as players including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Ja Morant, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounpo, Devin Booker and Paul George are all going to finish the season playing below 65 games. It's a possibility that MVP frontrunner Joel Embiid does as well, and the same is applied of the All-NBA forward Jimmy Butler. Assuming that seasons like this are going to be normal heading into the future, there will be a ton of unusual players that are going to be named to All-NBA teams and earning supermax eligibility in the process.

                    However, there is a change that could work in order to counteract these risks, which is now that according to the new CBA, All-NBA teams are now going to be positionless. At least in this scenario, higher quality players will be able to replace those who do not meet the games played threshold than those that would have been chosen with strict positional adherence. Centers in particular have long struggled under the old All-NBA system because only three of them could be selected compared to six guards and forwards. There is a potential chance that more centers earn supermax eligibility through All-NBA selections.

                    The new CBA has also made one direct change that addresses the supermax. During past seasons, teams were limited to only two players at each tier of supermax. There is the Rose Rule version that applies to younger players coming off of rookie contracts as well as the designated veteran version for players with at least seven years of experience. This proved to be especially troubling in trade negotiations, as teams were forbidden from having multiple players on their roster with that Rose Rule designation if they did not draft at least one of them. This prevented the Boston Celtics from trading for Anthony Davis when they had Kyrie Irving, and it could have seen impacts on the trade negotiations involving Ben Simmons over the past two offseasons.

                    So now, those restrictions have been lifted, and teams are now free to give the supermax to any player that is eligible for it. This will prove especially beneficial to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Prior rules would have prevented them from giving Evan Mobley the five-year, Rose Rule supermax that he may qualify for after next season because Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell already have such contracts. Now, Cleveland can comfortably pay all three, and the rest of the league can trade for supermax players freely so long as doing so does not break any other CBA rules.

                <h3>NBA Draft Adjustments</h3>
                <p>
                    The NBA has a designated structure in place for paying first-round picks. That is the rookie scale, and it creates a cap exception that allows teams to sign their first-round selections regardless of how much cap space they do or do not have. No such exception previously existed for second-round picks. Teams either had to dip into their mid-level exception to sign them, or they had to give them minimum-salary deals. The NBA will now call this "The Rob Pelinka Rule". Pelinka comes in as since he took over the Lakers, they have had a known tendency to sign their rookies to two-year minimum deals when using a small portion of the mid-level exception would have allowed him to sign them to longer contracts. This tactic allowed Talen Horton-Tucker to reach restricted free agency after only his second season, and the resulting expenditure may have cost the Lakers Alex Caruso. In that same offseason, Pelinka signed Austin Reaves to a two-year minimum deal instead of a mid-level contract. Reaves is now headed for a free-agent payday, alongside the promising rookie Max Christie is also headed for restricted free agency after his second season. There will now be a designated cap exception for second-round picks. Reaves wouldn't fall under this umbrella as an undrafted free agent, but Horton-Tucker and Christie would have, and all future second-round picks will.

                <h3>NBA Draft Combine Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the new CBA, all players that participate in the NBA Draft Combine will now be required to undergo physical exams, and the results of those exams will be distributed to select teams that will draft in the specific range that player is expected to be selected. This change will make it harder for agents to hide medical information from teams, which they do to steer their clients to certain places. This will still take place at the top of the draft, as those players can trust their preexisting draft stock and choose not o attend the combine, but it will show its importance and significance from the middle of the first round and on.

                <h3>In-season Tournament</h3>
                <p>One of the most significant aspects of the new CBA is the institution of an in-season tournament. It has been reported that the tournament will use pool play to determine a final eight that will move on to a single-elimination style tournament. However, there is an issue with this structure. Since there is a total of 30 teams in the league, the tournament can't create 8 even pools. Potential workarounds could be six pools of five with two wildcard teams moving on despite losign within their respective group. The more likely workaround is that this tournament was not designed for a 30-team league, but rather, a 32-team league that the NBA may become one day. Adam Silver, who is the commissioner of the NBA has stated how expansion is inevitable, but the league's focus has been on completing the CBA and getting a new media rights deal done. The NBA has seemed destined to add teams in Seattle and Los Vagas for quite some time, and by doing so would allow the tournament to evenly create 8 pools. As far as the victors are concerned, it is has been said that the winning players and coaches will be awarded with a cash prize.

                <p>
                    The last major change the new CBA has made is that for the first time in the league's history, players will now be able to own minority shares in NBA and WNBA teams. The exact mechanics of this rule have not yet been defined or released. Charania (Sports Journalist) reported that players will be able to invest in team ownership through an NBPA-selected private equity firm. Additionally, players will now be free to invest in a few other areas that they were not allowed to do previously. The players can now be sponsored by both sports gambling ventures and cannabis companies, provided that those things are legal where they are being promoted. An important note to take is that players will not be allowed to promote betting on sports themselves, but they are allowed to work with companies that operate in that kind of space. The new CBA has eliminated the testing for cannabis, which makes it a legal substance in the NBA.

                <h3>Modern NBA Style Of Play</h3>
                <p>
                    It goes without saying that the way Basketball is played today is vastly different compared to prior eras and generations. One of the major styles of Basketball today is using small ball methods and strategies. Small Ball is described as running a group of players at their unnatural position. As an example, in the 2000s, the Hall Of Fame Power Forward Chris Webber stood at 6'10, and due to his athletic frame and defensive ability, he would often be rotated to the center position. Another example is the current NBA Superstar Kevin Durant. Without shoes, Durant stands at about 6'11, but with shoes he stands at 7'0. Combined with his 7'5 wingspan and defensive capability, he often finds himself playing the Power Forward position, even though his natural position is at Small Forward. It is a common occurrence for every team in today's league to run a small ball lineup. The small ball style of play has existed for many decades in NBA history, but wasn't popularized until the recent NBA seasons. One of the most common results seen through the small ball style of play is the inflation of 3-point shots. The reason for the inflation in the volume of 3 pointers taken is definitely influenced by analytics. It basically boils down to the fact that 3 pointers are more than 2 pointers. So instead of players shooting midrange jumpers, layups, and dunks, which are all worth 2 points, players now shoot more 3s, simply because it has proven to be analytically correct to go for a shot that is worth more points. Obviously shooting 3s isn't an easy task as the 3-point line is 23-feet and 9-inches away from the basket on the arc and 16-feet and 9-inches from the baseline. It is a widely known fact that the closer you are to the basket, the more efficient the shots will be. But now with players specializing in taking 3-pointers, the 3-pointer has also become an efficient shot to most players. To put this into context here is an example. If an NBA team is shooting <strong>40%</strong> from the 3-point line, the opposing team would have to shoot <strong>60%</strong> on 2-point shots just to keep up with the other team. Before the small ball method became a modern tactic for NBA teams, it would be expected that the Point Guard, Shooting Guard, and Small Forward positions would make a majority of the perimeter shots, while the Power Forward and Center postions would be expected to take shots closer to the basket. But now with the style of small ball, the Power Forward and Center positions are now asked to take more perimeter shots due to the rules that limit what they can do in the painted area of the court. So now when a basketball game is played, Centers and Power Forwards are now seen shooting high volumes of 3-point shots. Traditional Power Forwards and Centers like Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal, and Charles Barkley are a rare sight in today's NBA as those players played more with their back to the basket and weren't relied on to shoot perimeter jumpers in order to score.

                <p>
                    Another aspect of the small ball method is the use of taller point guards to lead and initiate the offensive side of the ball. The days where point guards were the shortest players on the court isn't very common anymore. Traditional Point Guards like John Stockton (stood at 6'1), Tiny Archibald (stood at 6'1), and Tim Hardaway (stood at 6'0) are a thing of the past. Instead, players like Luka Doncic (stands at 6'8), Ben Simmons (stands at 6'10), and Lamelo Ball (stands at 6'8) occupy the Point Guard positions in today's game. Using tall Point Guards has its advantages. When operating in the high pick and roll, which is a predominant offense in the modern NBA, having a bigger ball handler that can see over the top of the defense in order to make cross-court skip passes is a huge benefit, in addition to being able to have little issue scoring on smaller guards.

                <p>
                    On the defensive side of the ball, if you have an entire five-man lineup that is capable of switching every pick and roll and every off-ball screen, you can avoid potential "mismatches", both on the interior and perimeter. One of the potential downfalls of small ball is of course rebounding. In the Lakers playoff series against the small ball system Houston Rockets in 2020, the Lakers, featuring a frontcourt rotation of James, Davis, JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard, outrebounded the James Harden Rockets in every game by an average of <strong>3.6</strong> rebounds and by <strong>58</strong> total boards in Games <strong>3-5</strong> to close out the series. The perfect small ball lineup would combat this by having traditionally tall centers who can rebound at a high level while also being athletic enough to switch on the perimeter. After trading away Clint Capella, the 2019-20 Rockets would often play 6'5 P.J. Tucker at center. Defensive switchability is also one of the reasons why tall two-way wings are so valuable. Wings that can create their own shot and play lockdown perimeter defense against multiple positions combine the best of both aspects of the game. Players like LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Paul George all fit this description. This is also where the “3-and-D” wing concept comes from. Wings that can play high-level, switchable defense while bringing the most valuable “role player” offensive skill (3-point shooting) to the table are the ultimate companion to a superstar player at any position.

                <h3>How 3-Point Shooting Translated Into the 2020ss</h3>
                <p>
                    With the rise in numbers of players who would often try and shoot from the 3-point line, it became almost a necessity to effieciently be able to shoot and score from the 3-point line. Even if a player had good offense, good defense, a strong build, or was a fast runner, if they could not shoot from the 3-point line consistently, they were deemed by the league to be unviable. 3-pointers quite literally became the new meta, and it meant that up and coming player didn't just have to be some of the world's best, they had to be the absolute best of the best across the entire league.

                <h3>How COVID-19 Impacted the League</h3>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 quickly established itself as a huge problem for the NBA throughout the rest of 2020. Soon after it began to massively spread, the NBA took immediate action and closed down all future games for a short unknown window of time. This rest period would cause the season to be shortened from 82 games to 72 since they didn't have the time to do 10 more games by the time the year was over. In this time, the NBA would construct an personal arena at Walt Disney World to finish the remaining 8 games as well as the playoffs. These would all be private games with no admissions avaliable for purchase, and would only be viewable through live television rather than in person. Furthermore, they created a strict protocol in the event a player catches COVID-19 to prevent other players from catching it. Players who caught COVID-19 would undergo heavy treatment and would be required to sit out for at least two weeks before being allowed to play again. This caused many players to miss time during that season, and would create sudden unforseen roster changes for teams with players affected.
