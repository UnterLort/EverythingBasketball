            <h3>How it all started</h3>
            <p>
                Believe it or not, Bill Russell had a slow start to his basketball career. In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills and fundamentals of the game as 
                he had difficulty understanding the game of basketball. This resulted in him being cut from multiple basketball teams at during his time in highschool. It 
                wouldn't be until Russell caught the attention of a college recruiter by the name of Hal DeJulio that his basketball career would fully take off. Hal was quick to 
                notice Russell's poor fundamentals and small scoring touch, but he also noticed that Russell had a unforeseen instinct for the game, especially when it came to his 
                performance in the clutch. This would be a common theme for Russell once he got to the league. Hal would offer Russell a scholarship to the University of San 
                Francisco, to which Russell excitedly accepted. Russell knew that this was his chance to escape the constant poverty and racism and Russell said himself that he swore 
                he would make the best of the opportunity. At USF, Russell would become his teams (San Francisco Dons) new starting center, as he stood at 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
                Russell's extraordinary defensive talent fit well with coach Phil Woolperts focus on defense and calculated half-court play. During his 3 years at USF, Russell 
                accumulated a number of accolades and achievements. Russell was not only a basketball player at USF, but he was additionally a track and field athlete. It was here 
                that Russell got to demonstrate his outstanding athleticism, that still seem impossible to achieve today, let alone back in the 50s.
            </p>
            <h3>Russell's Insane Athleticism</h3>
            <p>
                To further emphasize Russell's supurb athletic abilites, it is key to look at his frame. Russell was 6'10 and weighed around 230 pounds in his prime physical form. At 
                USF in his graduation year (1956), he competed in the high jump at the West Coast Relays. Russell would achieve a high jump measured at 6 feet 9 and 1/4 inches (or 
                2.06m), which placed him as the 2nd highest jumper in the United States and 7th in the whole world. Russell also remarked saying that in his playing days he could 
                get his eyes above the rim and touch the top of the backboard with ease. Not only could Russell jump through the roof, he also quite a pair of wheels on him too. 
                Russell would also compete in the 440 yard race (or 402.3m) where he finished with a time of 49.6 seconds. To go along with his extraordinary speed and leaping 
                ability, he also had a 7'4 wingspan.
