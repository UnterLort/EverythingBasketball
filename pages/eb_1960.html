                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>
                    This man goes by many names. "The Dipper", "The Stilt", and even "The Record Book", are all nicknames that belong to the most dominant player in NBA History, Wilton Norman Chamberlain, or Wilt Chamberlain for short. Wilt would go on to have an astonishing NBA Career, but the question remains, how did it all start? In 1953, Chamberlain would begin his Basketball journey at Overbrook High School, located in Philadelphia. As a freshmen, Wilt was already <strong>6ft 11in</strong>. Prior to Basketball, Wilt was a track and field athlete. Wilt would be known as the star player on the Overbrook Panthers Basketball team. According to the ESPN journalist, by the name of Hal Bock, he described Chamberlain as "scary, flat out frightenig ... before he came along, very few players at the center position possessed his level of athleticism, stature, and stamina. Chamberlain changed the game in fundamental ways no other player did." It was here where Chamberlain's three lifelong nicknames "Wilt the Stilt", "Goliath", and his personal favorite, "The Big Dipper". Chamberlain would go on to lead the team to two city championships, and during a 3 season stretch at Overbrook, recorded a 56-3 win-loss record. Wilt would go on to break Tom Gola's Philadelphia high school scoring record and would graduate with 2,252 points, as he would average 37.4 points per game.
                    
                    During the 1953 Overbrook season, Chamberlain would average 31 points per game, and would lead his team to a 71-62 win over Northeast High School of Guy Rodgers, who would become a future teammate of Wilt's in the NBA. Wilt would score 34 points as his Overbrook Panthers won the Philadelphia Public League title and would gain a berth in the city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league, the West Catholic High School. In that game against West Catholic, Chamberlain would be quadruple-teamed during the entire game, and even with his 29 point contribution, Overbrook would lose 54-42.

                    During his second season at Overbrook, Chamberlain continued to display his productive scoring when he set a high school record 71 points against Roxborough. The Panthers would secure the Public League title once more, after defeating Northeast again. During this game, Chamberlain had 40 points, and would later go on to win the city title by beating South Catholic 74-50, in a game where Chamberlain had scored 32 points, and led the Overbrook Panthers to a 19-0 season.
                    
                    In Chamberlain's third and final season at Overbrook, Chamberlain would continue to display his impressive high scoring ability, as he recorded a 74, 78, and 90 points in three consecutive games. Unlike the previous season, the Panthers would suffer a single loss, falling to Farrell High 59-58. Overbrook would win the Public League for a third time, as they beat West Philadelphia 78-60. Waiting for them in the championship game was a familiar foe, West Catholic. Chamberlain would go on to score 35 points and led Overbrook to beat West Catholic 83-42. For his efforts, Chamberlain would be retroactively honored as Mr. Basketball USA for 1955, fairly early for the selection.

                    In 1953, while still only a sophomore in high school, Chamberlain won his first championship. He would lead the Christian Street YMCA to the title in the national YMCA tournament in High Point, North Carolina, as they would beat the local favorite and the defending champion High Point team 85-79. Chamberlain would be the youngest member of the team. At 16 and 17, Chamberlain would play in several games for the semi-professional Quakertown Fays, under the pseudonym, George Marcus.

                    Chamberlain would go on to attend the University of Kansas, and continue his basketball journey. On December 3rd, 1956, Chamberlain would make his varsity basketball debut as the center for the Kansas Jayhawks. In his first game as a Kansas Jayhawk, Wilt scored 52 points and pulled in 31 rebounds, which broke two all-time Kansas records in a 87-69 win against the Northwestern Wildcats, which would feature Chamberlains future NBA teammate, Joe Ruklick. Chamberlain would lead a talented group of starters, which included Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky, and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks would go 13-1. Their only loss came against the Oklahoma State Cowboys with a final score of 56-54. Chamberlain would be named to first-team All-American . By this time, Chamberlain had developed many aspects of his game, which included his finger roll, his fadeaway jumper which he could also make as a bank shot, his passing ability, and his shot-blocking.
                    
                    Chamberlain's Jayhawks would be one out of twenty-three teams to be selected to play in the 1957 NCAA Basketball Tournament

                <p>
                    Believe it or not, Bill Russell had a slow start to his basketball career. In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills and fundamentals of the game as 
                    he had difficulty understanding the game of basketball. This resulted in him being cut from multiple basketball teams at during his time in highschool. It 
                    wouldn't be until Russell caught the attention of a college recruiter by the name of Hal DeJulio that his basketball career would fully take off. Hal was quick to 
                    notice Russell's poor fundamentals and small scoring touch, but he also noticed that Russell had a unforeseen instinct for the game, especially when it came to his 
                    performance in the clutch. This would be a common theme for Russell once he got to the league. Hal would offer Russell a scholarship to the University of San 
                    Francisco, to which Russell excitedly accepted. Russell knew that this was his chance to escape the constant poverty and racism and Russell said himself that he swore 
                    he would make the best of the opportunity. At USF, Russell would become his teams (San Francisco Dons) new starting center, as he stood at 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
                    Russell's extraordinary defensive talent fit well with coach Phil Woolperts focus on defense and calculated half-court play. During his 3 years at USF, Russell 
                    accumulated a number of accolades and achievements. Russell was not only a basketball player at USF, but he was additionally a track and field athlete. It was here 
                    that Russell got to demonstrate his outstanding athleticism, that still seem impossible to achieve today, let alone back in the 50s.

                <h3>Russell's Insane Athleticism</h3>
                <p>
                    To further emphasize Russell's supurb athletic abilites, it is key to look at his frame. Russell was <strong>6'10</strong> and weighed around <strong>230</strong> pounds in his prime physical form. At USF in his graduation year (1956), he competed in the high jump at the West Coast Relays. Russell would achieve a high jump measured at <strong>6 feet 9 and 1/4 inches (or 2.06m)</strong>, which placed him as the <strong>2nd</strong> highest jumper in the United States and <strong>7th</strong> in the whole world. Russell also remarked saying that in his playing days, he could get his eyes above the rim and touch the top of the backboard with ease. Not only could Russell jump through the roof, he also quite a pair of wheels on him too. Russell would also compete in the <strong>440 yard race (or 402.3m)</strong> where he finished with a time of <strong>49.6 seconds</strong>. To go along with his extraordinary speed and leaping ability, he also had a <strong>7'4</strong> wingspan.

                <h3>Bill Russell's NBA Run</h3>
                <p>
                    If you thought Russell's run in the NBA was smooth, you would be heavily mistaken. Coming into the 1956 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics had the 1st overall pick, but didn't select Russell. Boston forfeited the first pick to select Forward Tommy Heinsohn, with the territorial pick option. This draft option is no longer present in the NBA Draft, but it existed from 1949 to 1965. The NBA would initiate a special rule, which would give teams exclusive rights to claim local college players. This was done to generate more interest in the professional league, as these picks would give fans the chance to watch popular local college players play for their hometown team. As part of the territorial pick rules, Boston had to forefeit their first round pick. Boston's first round pick would end up in the hands of the Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), but they would decide to pass on drafting Russell. Before the draft, Boston Celtic's coach Red Auerbach persuaded the Celtics owner at the time, Walter Brown, to guarantee Rochester owner, Les Harrison, a multitude of lucrative shows performed by the Ice Capade Dancers (to which Brown was a partial owner of). The Ice Capades were traveling entertainment shows that would feature theatrical ice skating performances. In return for providing these shows to Rochester, Harrison and the Rochester Royals would skip Russell with the first pick. However, there were 3 other main reasons why Rochester decided to pass on Russell and select Si Green with the first pick. The first reason included Russell's delayed arrival and debut until late December, as he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team. The second reason was that the Harlem Globetrotters were predicted to offer Russell a huge contract offer for his services. The third reason was that there was some doubt among a variety of pro coaches that Russell would star in the professional game as he did so in college. Even with Rochester not selecting Russell, Boston wasn't out of the dark yet. The Saint Louis Hawks had the second pick, and they actually did select Russell. However, a few days before the draft, the Celtics and Hawks agreed to a deal that would send All-Star Ed Macauley and draft rights to Cliff Hagan in return for the second overall pick. Russell would technically be picked by the Hawks, but sent to Boston right after. With Russell now secured, the Celtics looked like an entirely different team, as they not only secured 1, but 3 future Hall Of Famers in 1 draft.

                    The season prior to the addition of Russell, the Celtics finished with a 39-33 record, which placed them 2nd in the NBA Eastern Division, behind the Philadelphia Warriors who finished with a strong 45-27 record, which was the best record in the league that season. However, the Celtics didn't make much noise in the playoffs, as they were defeated by the Syracuse Nationals in 3 games. The Celtics also had the 3rd worst defense in the league finishing, 6th out of 8 in defensive rating. The Philadelphia Warriors would actually go on to win the NBA Championship that season as they were led by a handful of stars including the Hall Of Famers Paul Arizin, Neil Johnston, and Tom Gola. Rounding out that roster included scoring threats like Jack George and Joe Graboski. With this core group of guys, they dismantled the Syracuse Nationals in only 5 games, the same team who had just beaten Boston in the previous round. In those 5 games against Syracuse, 5 players from Philadelphia averaged over double digit points, and 2 averaged over double digit rebounds. Compared to Syracuse who had only 4 players who averaged over double digit points, 1 player who averaged double digit rebounds, and 1 player who averaged over double digit assists. After defeating Syracuse, Philadelphia was set to face off against the Fort Wayne Pistons. Philadelphia would control the pace for the whole series as they beat Fort Wayne in 5 games (4-1).
                    
                    With the main addition of Russell, and Tommy Heinsohn, the Celtics finished with a 44-28 record, finishing 1st in the NBA Eastern Division, and having the best record in the league. The Celtics also had the best defense in the league, finishing 1st out of 8. With other players like Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, and Arnie Risen rounding out the roster, the Celtics had a total of 7 future Hall Of Famers on their roster that season. Tommy Heinsohn would earn the Rookie Of The Year Award that year with averages of 16.2 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 1.6 APG. The Celtics would make their way into the playoffs, and waiting for them was a familiar foe, the Syracuse Nationals. However, the outcome was vastly different than last years result. The Celtics would not only avenge their loss to Syracuse from last year, but they dominated them, sweeping them 3-0. In those 3 games, Russell averaged a tame 15.3 PPG and an absurd 28.0 RPG. Heinsohn led the Celtics in PPG average as he put up 20.3 PPG in those 3 games verse Syracuse. Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman also added in their own contributions as Cousy averaged 19.0 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 9.7 APG and Sharman averaged 19.3 PPG and 3.0 RPG over the course of the series. The Celtics would find themselves going up against Hall Of Famer Bob Pettit and the St. Louis Hawks. This Hawks squad was very talented with future Hall Of Famers Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan, Alex Hannum, Ed Macauley, and Slater Martin all on the roster. This series would go to a hard fought 7th game, where the Celtics would pull away with the victory and the championship trophy. Russell put up 19 points, a monsterous 32 rebounds, and blocked 5 shots in the deciding 7th game, securing his 1st of many championships to come. Tommy Heinsohn would lead the Celtics in scoring in the 7th game with 37 points, and for good measure, he secured 23 rebounds.
                    
                    With Boston securing their first championship ring in franchise history, it was only a matter of time until they became the dynasty we know today. In the next years draft, the Celtics secured another future Hall Of Famer, the 6'4 Shooting Guard, Sam Jones. With Sam Jones now secured on the roster, the Celtics would improve their record from the previous season, going from a 44 win team, to a 49 win team. The Celtics finished the regular season with a 49-23 record, which placed them 1st in the Eastern Division, and 1st in the whole league. Russell would have a number of standout performances throughout the regular season, including a game against the Detroit Pistons, where he put up 14 points, 19 rebounds, and an absurd 17 blocks. Less than a week later, Russell would play against the Pistons again, but this time he would put up 15 points, 30 rebounds, and 12 blocks. Then during a matchup with the Philadelphia Warriors, Russell would put up 18 points, 35 rebounds, and 11 blocks. These games resulted in wins for Russell and the Celtics. This season was also Russell's first year as an All-Star, which he would be selected to often during the majority of his career. The Celtics would head into the playoffs and their first matchup would be with the Philadelphia Warriors. This series wouldn't be too much to handle for Boston as they beat the Warriors 4-1. Russell would have standout performances in Game 3 and Game 5 of the series. In Game 3, Russell put up 14 points and an insane 40 rebounds to bring Boston the win at the Boston Garden. In Game 5 to close out the series, Russell put up 18 points and 30 rebounds to win the series for the Celtics at the Boston Garden. Heading into the NBA Finals the Celtics were set to play a familiar foe, the Saint Louis Hawks. However, this series would prove to be a lot different then last season's finals. In the first two games, each team split at 1-1, but in Game 3, Russell would go down with a foot injury, which heavily changed the course of the series. Russell would return for Game 6, but the Celtics were already down 2-3. Russell didn't see much playing time, as he only played 20 minutes. The Hawks would come out victorious in the deciding Game 6, with their superstar Bob Pettit who dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds to win the game by 1 point for the Hawks. Still to this very day, this championship is the only championship the hawks had ever won.

                    Luckily for Boston, they would once again gain another fantastic piece to their roster in the off-season. Drafted alongside Bill Russell, and Tom Heinsohn, in '56 the Celtics would also draft future Hall-Of-Famer, K.C Jones. However, Jones wouldn't begin playing for them until 1958 as he would serve two years in the military and would play some exhibition games as a defensive back for the Los Angeles Rams, until he would suffer a leg injury, causing him to quit the sport. He then would head to the Boston training camp to begin his NBA career. With established Boston backcourt guards like Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman already on the roster, K.C wouldn't see much of the floor as he played a reserve roll during his rookie year. He would operate as the backup to Cousy 12 to 13 minutes per game and averaged 3.5 points. K.C fit perfectly in Boston's system and was able to make the most of the opportunity by winning 8x championships with the Celtics. K.C's minutes would continue to increase progressively throughout the coming seasons, and when Bob Cousy retired, K.C. would average 30.3 minutes per game in the 1963-64 season. From 1964-65 to 1966-67, K.C. would average 32.2 minutes per game while also averaging 7.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists on 39.3% field goal percentage and 65.5% free throw percentage. K.C. would remain as the Celtics main point guard for the rest of his career. With the main addition of K.C., the Celtics finished with a 52-20 record, which was the best record in the Eastern Division and the whole league. Boston would head into the playoffs and waiting for them in the Eastern Division finals was the 35-37 Syracuse Nationals, who would take Boston to 7 games before being eliminated by the Celtics. Boston would then go on to verse the 33-39 Minneapolis Lakers. The Minneapolis Lakers would be led by their star rookie and future Hall of Famer, Elgin Baylor, who averaged 24.9 points per game, 15.0 rebounds per game, and 4.1 assists per game in the regular season and 25.5 points per game, 12.0 rebounds per game, and 3.3 assists per game in the playoffs. In the finals, Baylor would average 22.8 points per game, and 11.8 rebounds per game in the series. With other future Hall of Famers Vern Mikkelsen and Slick Leonard on the roster, the Lakers definitely had the talent to put up a fight against Boston, but ultimately couldn't put it all together, which resulted in them getting swept. This would be quite the common theme for the Lakers as they would fall short to the Celtics a total of 6 times in the finals during the 60s. This matchup would also mark the beginning of one of the best rivalries in all of American sports, the Celtics and the Lakers. This championship would also kick start a streak for the Celtics as from 1959 to 1966, they would go on to win a record 8 straight championships, beating the lakers an additional 4 times in that stretch. No team in NBA history has ever won 4 or more rings in a row besides the 60s Celtics. The Celtics also beat the St. Louis Hawks twice and the San Francisco Warriors once during their 8 consecutive championship runs. During the Celtics 8 consecutive title runs, they would continue to add future Hall of Fame talent to the roster. In the 1960 NBA Draft, the Celtics selected Tom "Satch" Sanders, who would be a player who would constantly rotate between the starting lineup and a spot of the bench. Sanders was a well known defender standing at 6'6 at the wing who would be tasked in guarding some of the most talented wings in the league like Elgin Baylor and many others. No matter if it was in the starting lineup or a supporting role off the bench, Sanders always seemed to be one of the difference makers in the outcome of games. In the 1961-62 season, the Celtics acquired the 6'5 point guard/shooting guard and future Hall of Famer, Carl Braun. By the time the Celtics added Braun to the roster, he was 34 years old and past his prime years, which he spent in New York. He played only 48 games, and played for only an average of 8.6 minutes per game that season. He didn't contribute much to the team, but nonetheless, adding an additional future Hall of Famer to the roster definitely is something to shy away from. Heading into the 1962-63 season, the Celtics would acquire future Hall of Famer John "Hondo" Havlicek in the 1962 NBA Draft with the 9th pick in the 1st round. Havlicek was a 6'5 small forward/shooting guard who was known to have remarkable athleticism, speed, skill, and intelligence. During his rookie year, Havlicek would come off the bench and put up solid all around numbers of 14.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game on 44.5% field goal efficiency and 72.8% free throw efficiency. Havlicek would continue to develop during the coming seasons and would find himself in the starting lineup in no time. Despite the rich Celtic history, Havlicek would become (and still remains) as the Celtics all time leading scorer in the regular season with 26,395 points. Havlicek would eventually become the key and best player on the Celtic teams in the 70s as he would help them win 2 more championships, tallying to a grand total of 8 total championships for Havlicek on his resume. Havlicek would also become the 1973-74 Finals MVP as the Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks in 7 games. One of Havlicek's best moments would come on April 15th, 1965, where the Celtics were facing elimination by Wilt Chamberlain and the Philadelphia 76ers. Nearing the very end of the 4th quarter, the 76ers were down 107-110. Wilt would go on to dunk the ball, officially scoring the last 10 points for the 76ers and bringing the lead down to 1 point. Bill Russell would take the ball out of bounds to inbound. However, when Russell went to inbound the ball, it hit a wire, which then deflected the ball out of bounds, giving the possession back to Philadelphia under their own basket. After the Celtics had called a timeout, Hal Greer (another Future Hall of Famer) would take the ball out of bounds to inbound it. Once the player is given the ball by the referee, they have 5 seconds to inbound the ball. If the inbounder still has the ball when 5 seconds have passed, the ball goes to the opponent. When reflecting on this moment, Havlicek would go on to say that whne the official handed the ball to Greer, he bagan counting in his head, from 1000 to 1005. Havlicek said that once he reached 1004, he knew that Greer was looking for Chet Walker (another future Hall of Famer), so he turned his head slightly to peak at the direction of the pass and once he saw the ball coming, he intercepted the pass and stole the ball, putting the game away for Boston and helping them to move on to the NBA Finals. Havlicek said that in that moment, the events that played out felt like it was in slow motion for him, which is why he was able to react quickly on the inbound pass to Walker from Greer. Johnny Most (who was a famous American Sports Announcer and was primarily known for his gravelly radio voice for the Boston Celtics from 1953 to 1990) was the radio announcer during this game and when Havlicek stole the ball, he shouted in excitement, which has become one of the most popular sports announcer moments in history. On April 9th, 1978, Havlicek would play the last game of his career and announce his retirement from the league. The Celtics would also acquire the 6'9 center, Clyde Lovellette, who would also be a future Hall of Famer. Like Braun, the Celtics acquired Lovellette during the twilight years of his career. Lovellette would spend the prime of his career playing for the Lakers, Cincinnati Royals, and St. Louis Hawks. During his prime years, he was a 20 point per game scorer, while also averaging 11.3 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.9 assists per game. During his time in Boston, he would only average 6.6 points per game, 2.9 rebounds, and 0.5 assists per game, while also playing an average of 9.5 minutes per game. He manly served as a backup center off the bench for Boston during his two seasons there.

                    In the 1963-64 season, the Celtics acquired the 6'6 small forward/power forward Willie Naulls from the San Francisco Warriors and the 6'3 point guard/shooting guard Larry Siegfried from the Cincinnati Royals. Willie was past his prime years with New York, but still chipped in 10.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, while playing an average of nearly 20 minutes per game (19.6 minutes per game respectively) during the 3 seasons he spent in Boston. Luckily for Boston, Siegfried was a rookie when he was added to the roster and would develop into a solid guard for them. He only chipped in 3.3 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game during that season as he played only 8.4 minutes per game and played in only 31 games. Siegfried would develop into a 13.4 points per game scorer, to go along with 3.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game during his prime years in Boston, while also playing 27.9 minutes per game.
