                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>
                    This man goes by many names. "The Dipper", "The Stilt", and even "The Record Book", are all nicknames that belong to the most dominant player in NBA History, Wilton Norman Chamberlain, or Wilt Chamberlain for short. Wilt would go on to have an astonishing NBA Career, but the question remains, how did it all start? In 1953, Chamberlain would begin his Basketball journey at Overbrook High School, located in Philadelphia. As a freshmen, Wilt was already <strong>6ft 11in</strong>. Prior to Basketball, Wilt was a track and field athlete. Wilt would be known as the star player on the Overbrook Panthers Basketball team. According to the ESPN journalist, by the name of Hal Bock, he described Chamberlain as "scary, flat out frightening ... before he came along, very few players at the center position possessed his level of athleticism, stature, and stamina. Chamberlain changed the game in fundamental ways no other player did." It was here where Chamberlain's three lifelong nicknames "Wilt the Stilt", "Goliath", and his personal favorite, "The Big Dipper". Chamberlain would go on to lead the team to two city championships, and during a 3 season stretch at Overbrook, recorded a <strong>56-3</strong> win-loss record. Wilt would go on to break Tom Gola's Philadelphia high school scoring record and would graduate with <strong>2,252</strong> points, as he would average <strong>37.4</strong> points per game.
                    
                    During the 1953 Overbrook season, Chamberlain would average <strong>31</strong> points per game, and would lead his team to a <strong>71-62</strong> win over Northeast High School of Guy Rodgers, who would become a future teammate of Wilt's in the NBA. Wilt would score <strong>34</strong> points as his Overbrook Panthers won the Philadelphia Public League title and would gain a berth in the city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league, the West Catholic High School. In that game against West Catholic, Chamberlain would be quadruple-teamed during the entire game, and even with his <strong>29</strong> point contribution, Overbrook would lose <strong>54-42</strong>.

                    During his second season at Overbrook, Chamberlain continued to display his productive scoring when he set a high school record <strong>71</strong> points against Roxborough. The Panthers would secure the Public League title once more, after defeating Northeast again. During this game, Chamberlain had <strong>40</strong> points, and would later go on to win the city title by beating South Catholic <strong>74-50</strong>, in a game where Chamberlain had scored <strong>32</strong> points, and led the Overbrook Panthers to a <strong>19-0</strong> season.
                    
                    In Chamberlain's third and final season at Overbrook, Chamberlain would continue to display his impressive high scoring ability, as he recorded a <strong>74, 78, and 90</strong> points in <strong>3</strong> consecutive games. Unlike the previous season, the Panthers would suffer a single loss, falling to Farrell High <strong>59-58</strong>. Overbrook would win the Public League for a third time, as they beat West Philadelphia <strong>78-60</strong>. Waiting for them in the championship game was a familiar foe, West Catholic. Chamberlain would go on to score <strong>35</strong> points and led Overbrook to beat West Catholic <strong>83-42</strong>. For his efforts, Chamberlain would be retroactively honored as Mr. Basketball USA for 1955, fairly early for the selection.

                    In 1953, while still only a sophomore in high school, Chamberlain won his <strong>1st</strong> championship. He would lead the Christian Street YMCA to the title in the national YMCA tournament in High Point, North Carolina, as they would beat the local favorite and the defending champion High Point team <strong>85-79</strong>. Chamberlain would be the youngest member of the team. At 16 and 17, Chamberlain would play in several games for the semi-professional Quakertown Fays, under the pseudonym, George Marcus.

                    Chamberlain would go on to attend the University of Kansas, and continue his basketball journey. On December 3rd, 1956, Chamberlain would make his varsity basketball debut as the center for the Kansas Jayhawks. In his <strong>1st</strong> game as a Kansas Jayhawk, Wilt scored <strong>52</strong> points and pulled in <strong>31</strong> rebounds, which broke two all-time Kansas records in a <strong>87-69</strong> win against the Northwestern Wildcats, which would feature Chamberlains future NBA teammate, Joe Ruklick. Chamberlain would lead a talented group of starters, which included Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky, and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks would go <strong>13-1</strong>. Their only loss came against the Oklahoma State Cowboys with a final score of <strong>56-54</strong>. Chamberlain would be named to first-team All-American. By this time, Chamberlain had developed many aspects of his game, which included his finger roll, his fadeaway jumper which he could also make as a bank shot, his passing ability, and his shot-blocking.
                    
                    Chamberlain's Jayhawks would be <strong>1</strong> out of <strong>23</strong> teams to be selected to play in the 1957 NCAA Basketball Tournament. The Midwest Regional was to be held in Dallas, Texas, which at the time was segregated. In the first game of the tournament, the Jayhawks played an all-white SMU Mustangs. Kansas University would win the game <strong>73-65</strong> in overtime. The next game came against Oklahoma City and Kansas would win once more with a final score of <strong>81-61</strong>. Into the semi-finals the Jayhawks went, and waiting for them was the two-time defending champions, the San Francisco Dons. Chamberlain would lead the way with <strong>32</strong> points, <strong>11</strong> rebounds, and reportedly having at least <strong>7</strong> blocks, as he helped to lead the Jayhawks to defeat the Dons, <strong>80-56</strong>. Since Chamberlain's performance led Kansas to an incredible lead, he would sit on the bench for the final 3:45 left to go in the game.
                    
                    The NCAA Finals would see Chamberlain's 2nd-ranked Jayhawks versus the 1st-ranked, undefeated North Carolina Tar Heels, who would be led by the All-American and National Player of the Year, Lennie Rosenbluth. During the game, the Tar Heels head coach, Frank McGuire (who would one day coach Wilt), used some unorthodox methods to counter Wilt's dominance. For the tip-off, McGuire would send in the shortest player on the roster, Tommy Kearns, in order to annoy Chamberlain. The Tar Heels would then spend the rest of the night triple-teaming Wilt, with one defender in front, one in the back, and another one coming in as soon as he got possession of the ball. With the Heels focus on slowing down Chamberlain, the Jayhawks would only shoot a terrible <strong>27%</strong> from the field, opposed to the Heels themselves, who shot <strong>64%</strong> from the field. At halftime, the Jayhawks were down <strong>22-29</strong>. With <strong>10</strong> minutes remaining, North Carolina would lead <strong>40-37</strong> and would play a game of keep away by passing the ball around with no intention of scoring. After the Heel's committed several turnovers, before they knew it, the game was all tied up at <strong>46</strong> a piece by the end of regulation. Both North Carolina and Kansas would score two points in the first overtime, while Kansas would proceed to freeze the ball, keeping the score tied at <strong>48</strong>, in the second overtime. Then in the third overtime, the Heels would score two consecutive baskets, however Chamberlain responded with a <strong>3-point</strong> play, which would leave Kansas trailing <strong>52-51</strong>. After Chamberlain scored a basket, Kansas would now have a <strong>1</strong> point lead. With only <strong>10</strong> seconds remaining, Heels' center Joe Quigg would pump fake, then proceed to drive to the rim. Meeting him there was Chamberlain, who blocked Quigg's shot. However, it was also called for a foul. Quigg would proceed to knock down both free throws, putting the Heel's up <strong>54-53</strong>. For the last play of the game, Harp (who was coaching Chamberlain after Phog Allen retired), called for Ron to inbound the ball to Chamberlain in the low post. However, the pass would be tipped by Quigg, and would be recovered, and the Tar Heels would win the game. Even with the defeat, Chamberlain's <strong>23</strong> points and <strong>14</strong> rebounds, helped to earn him the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Many comments would begin to surface that the loss deeply bothered Chamberlain, as this wasn't the first time Chamberlain's team lost, even though he put up impressive numbers. Chamberlain would confirm these comments by saying it was the most painful loss of his life. However, he did achieve history as that national final was the only final to ever go into <strong>3</strong> overtimes.
                    
                    With Chamberlain heading into his junior year, the matchups the Jayhawks' faced proved to be more frustrating for Wilt. Understanding how talented Wilt was, opposing teams resorted to freeze ball tactics, in order to keep Wilt's scoring to a minimum. Chamberlain would still average <strong>30.1</strong> points for the season and help lead his Jayhawks to an <strong>18-5</strong> record, however three of those losses came when Wilt was out with a urinary infection. Due to Kansas finishing second in the league, and at the time only conference winners were invited to the NCAA Tournament, the season would end for the Jayhawk's there. Chamberlain would still be named an All-American, along with future NBA Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor of Seattle University and Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, to go along with Chamberlain's old rival Guy Rodgers, who was now playing for Temple University.
                    
                    Chamberlain would lose his enjoyment from NCAA Basketball and in an attempt to earn some money, he left college in search of a sum of <strong>$10,000</strong>, while NBA players were earning $9,000 for the whole season. In the two seasons Chamberlain spent at Kansas University, he would average <strong>29.9</strong> points and <strong>18.3</strong> rebounds per game, tallying a total of <strong>1,433</strong> points and <strong>877</strong> rebounds, and would ultimately lead Kansas to one Big Seven championship. Shockingly enough, before Chamberlain turned 21, he had already been featured in American magazines such as Time, Life, Look, and Newsweek.
                    
                    With the NBA not accepting players until after they had completed college and graduated, Chamberlain would have to go pro, but in a different manner. Chamberlain would famously sign with the esteemed Harlem Globetrotters and play for them in 1958, for a sum of <strong>$50,000</strong>. Over the next coming years, Chamberlain would join the Globetrotters commonly in the off-season. Chamberlain would fondly remember his time with Harlem as he was no longer ridiculed at or pressured to break records, but rather was a part of a bunch of talented artists who enjoyed to entertain the crowd. On March 9 of 2000, Chamberlain's No. 13 jersey was retired by the Globetrotters.

                <h3>Rookie Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Chamberlain's NBA Career would begin in the 1959-60 season, as he was drafted in the 1959 NBA Draft with the territorial selection (3rd Pick, 3rd Overall, in the 1st Round) by the Philadelphia Warriors. Chamberlain would join a Philadelphia Warriors team, coached by Neil Johnston, that included himself, guard Tom Gola, forward Paul “Pitchin” Arizin, guard Ernie Beck, and a familiar face, guard Guy Rodgers. In his <strong>1st</strong> ever NBA game of his career, Chamberlain put up <strong>43</strong> points and <strong>28</strong> rebounds, against the New York Knicks. In his <strong>3rd</strong> ever NBA game of his career, Chamberlain recorded <strong>41</strong> points and a then-career-high <strong>40</strong> rebounds in a <strong>124-113</strong> win over the Syracuse Nationals. In Chamberlain's <strong>4th</strong> ever NBA game, Chamberlain versed a familiar face, the Celtics Hall of Fame coach, Red Auerbach, (who tried to recruit him years earlier, but never went through). This game would also be the beginning of one of the best known rivalries in all of NBA history (Russell vs Chamberlain). Chamberlain would outscore Russell with <strong>30</strong> points, compared to Russell's <strong>28</strong> points, but Boston would secure the win (which would be quite the common theme for Wilt). November 10th, 1959, Chamberlain would tally <strong>39</strong> points and a new career-high of <strong>43</strong> rebounds in a <strong>126-125</strong> win over the Knicks. On January 25, 1960, Chamberlain would record a rare feat in the NBA, recording at least <strong>50</strong> points and <strong>40</strong> rebounds in an NBA game. During that game specifically, against the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain put up an insane <strong>58</strong> points, <strong>42</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists, which resulted in a win for the Philadelphia Warriors. His <strong>58</strong> points that evening was (at that point) a career high for him, which he would later tie on February 21, as he recorded <strong>58</strong> points with <strong>24</strong> rebounds in a <strong>131-121</strong> win over the Knicks. Interestingly enough, in <strong>71</strong> out of the <strong>72</strong> games Chamberlain played in his rookie season, he scored at least <strong>20</strong> points. There was only <strong>1</strong> game in his rookie season where he didn't put up <strong>20</strong> or more points (which was a game in which he achieved only <strong>5</strong> points). Funny enough, this was also the same game where Chamberlain would put up less than double-digit rebounds, tallying only <strong>2</strong>. Like his scoring, over the course of the other <strong>71</strong> games Chamberlain played in his rookie season, he put up at least double-digit rebounding numbers. Over the course of Chamberlain's rookie season, he averaged <strong>37.6</strong> points and <strong>27</strong> rebounds, which convincingly broke the previous regular-season records as a rookie. Chamberlain would only need <strong>56</strong> games to score <strong>2,102</strong> points, breaking the all-time regular-season scoring record of Bob Pettit, who needed <strong>72</strong> games to score <strong>2,101</strong> points (in his rookie season). Chamberlain would break <strong>8</strong> NBA records that season, and to go along with that, he was named both Rookie of the Year and the MVP that season. Chamberlain would cap off his rookie season with a selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team, in which he would win the All-Star Game and the All-Star Game MVP award with a <strong>23</strong> point and <strong>25</strong> rebound display. Other standout performances from Wilt's rookie season came during his <strong>14th, 33rd, 64th, and 68th</strong> games. His <strong>14th</strong> game came against the Boston Celtics where he put up <strong>45</strong> points, <strong>35</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>6</strong> blocks, which resulted in a <strong>123-113</strong> win. His <strong>33rd</strong> game came against the Minneapolis Lakers, in which Chamberlain put up <strong>52</strong> points, <strong>20</strong> rebounds, and <strong>10</strong> blocks, which was enough to beat the Lakers with a final score of <strong>126-111</strong>. All of the field goals Wilt made this game were all dunks. In Chamberlain's <strong>64th</strong> game was a rematch against the Celtics, in which Chamberlain would put up <strong>53</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>11</strong> blocks to lead the Warriors to a <strong>126-108</strong> victory. Lastly, in Chamberlain's <strong>68th</strong> game, which once again came against the Celtics, Chamberlain recorded <strong>39</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>14</strong> blocks. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be enough as Boston won with a final score of <strong>133-119</strong>. 
                    
                    The Warriors would head into the 1960 NBA playoffs, and waiting for them in the first round was the <strong>45-30</strong> Syracuse Nationals. The Warriors would easily handle them in <strong>3</strong> games, which would set up a matchup versus the Eastern Division champions, the Boston Celtics. This would be one of many playoffs loses Chamberlain would face verse the Celtics. Red Auerbach had instructed forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain. So whenever the Warriors would be shooting foul shots, Heinsohn would proceed to grab and shove Chamberlain, in order to prevent him from using his immense speed to recover on defense. The intention of this was that the Celtics would proceed to throw the ball in fast enough, while Wilt was not underneath his own basket, allowing for a ton of easy fastbreak baskets. The teams would split the series in the first two games. However, with Chamberlain's frustrations with Heinsohn hounding him all game, he would proceed to punch Heinsohn during the third game of the series. As a result of the scuffle, Chamberlain would injure his hand, and Philadelphia would proceed to lose the next two games. With his hand recovered from the punch, Chamberlain would return for the fifth game of the series and contributed <strong>50</strong> points and <strong>35</strong> rebounds in a <strong>128-107</strong> win for Philadelphia over Boston, which would extend the series to a sixth game. It would ultimately be Heinsohn who would put the game, and series away, as he scored the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in, resulting in the Warriors losing the series <strong>4-2</strong>. Despite his loss in the playoffs, Chamberlain would be awarded with the Rookie of the Year and the League MVP, which is something only himself and future Hall of Fame Center Wes Unseld would ever accomplish.

                    Being fed up with the constant double or even triple teams, and teams coming down on him with hard personal fouls, Chamberlain would shock the Warrior nation as he announced considering retirement. Chamberlain was also concerned that he would lose his cool one day, if he continued to play against double and triple teams and being constantly fouled hard by other teams. To put into perspective the amount of hard fouls Wilt was going up against night in and night out, the Celtic forward Tom Heinsohn was quoted to say "Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever." Team Executive Edward "Eddie" Gottlieb would persuade Chamberlain back into returning to the NBA, as he raised Chamberlain's salary to <strong>$65,000</strong>.

                <h3>Sophomore Year</h3>
                <p>
                    Chamberlain would start his 1960-61 season with a <strong>42</strong> point and <strong>31</strong> rebound display in a <strong>133-123</strong> winning effort against the Syracuse Nationals. On November 24th, 1960, Chamberlain would make NBA history as he set the record for the most rebounds by a player in a single game, as he grabbed an insane <strong>55</strong> rebounds, to go along with <strong>34</strong> points, <strong>4</strong> assists, and even <strong>8</strong> blocks, against Bill Russell and the Celtics. However, Wilt fell short once again as Russell and the Celtics would prevail over the Warriors, winning the game <strong>132-129</strong>. On November 29th, Chamberlain recorded <strong>44</strong> points, <strong>38</strong> rebounds, and a then-career-high <strong>7</strong> assists in a <strong>122-121</strong> win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Chamberlain would improve from his rookie season statistics, as he averaged <strong>38.4</strong> points and <strong>27.2</strong> rebounds per game that season. Chamberlain would become the <strong>1st</strong> player to break the <strong>3,000</strong> point barrier, and is still is the first and only player to break the <strong>2,000</strong> rebound barrier for a single season, grabbing <strong>2,149</strong> rebounds that season. Chamberlain was also handed his first field goal percentage title as he hit a mind blowing <strong>50.9%</strong> of his field goals over the course of the season. Chamberlain was especially dominant this season for his Warriors as he scored near <strong>32%</strong> of his teams points and grabbed <strong>30.4%</strong> of the Warriors rebounds. Wilt would once again have a multitude of standout performances over the course of the season. In a game against the Cincinnati Royals on November 1st, 1960, Chamberlain put up <strong>33</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and <strong>9</strong> blocks in a <strong>131-113</strong> win. On November 4th, 1960, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain recorded <strong>44</strong> points, <strong>39</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks in a <strong>136-121</strong> victory. On November 10th, 1960, Chamberlain recorded <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>30</strong> rebounds, <strong>6</strong> assists, and <strong>10</strong> blocks in a <strong>116-112</strong> win over the New York Knicks. Lastly, on February 5th, 1961, Chamberlain once again torch the Knicks with <strong>55</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>8</strong> blocks in a <strong>136-128</strong> win. Shockingly enough, those <strong>8</strong> blocks came in only the first quarter of play, meaning if he kept that same pace, he was on track to have recorded <strong>32</strong> blocks that game. Chamberlain's regular season success wouldn't translate to the post-season as the Warriors were eliminated by the Syracuse Nationals, in a three-game sweep. Comments then began to surface about Chamberlain being "difficult" and him not respecting coach Johnston, who made it clear that he could not handle the star center.

                <h3>Junior Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Whenever someone brings up Wilt, one of the most popular things he is praised for is his 1961-62 campaign. To put it simply, Chamberlain steamrolled the league on an individual level. With the replacement of coach Johnston with Frank McGuire, who Wilt played against in the triple overtime loss in the NCAA championship against the Tar Heels, that McGuire was coaching. In that season, Chamberlain would set several all-time records, which have never been challenged. Chamberlain would average an insane <strong>50.4</strong> points and <strong>25.7</strong> rebounds. Even more famous was his legendary game that came on March 2, 1962, in the Hershey Arena, located in Philadelphia. Most people know what game this was, this was the game where Wilt Chamberlain would score <strong>100</strong> points on his own to lead the Warriors to a <strong>169-147</strong> win over the New York Knicks. In that game, Chamberlain not only put up <strong>100</strong> points, he also secured <strong>25</strong> rebounds and <strong>2</strong> assists. On this night, Chamberlain notched a total of <strong>8</strong> records for the NBA record book. Those records included: Most points in a single game (<strong>100</strong>), Most points scored in a half (<strong>59</strong> points in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals made in a game (<strong>36</strong>), Most field goals attempted in a game (<strong>63</strong>), Most field goals made in a half (<strong>22</strong> in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals attempted in a half (<strong>37</strong> in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals attempted in a quarter (<strong>21</strong> in the <strong>4th</strong> quarter), Most free throws made in a game (<strong>28</strong>). This game was also part of an incredible streak, where Chamberlain scored at least <strong>60</strong> points in <strong>3</strong> consecutive games, and the <strong>4th</strong> game in that streak was this one, with <strong>100</strong> points. That streak in itself is an NBA record for the Most consecutive <strong>60</strong> point games with a total of <strong>4</strong>. Also, Wilt Chamberlain is the only player to ever score <strong>60</strong> points in back-to-back games, which is a personal and league record.

                    Additional records Chamberlain set in this season included: Most <strong>50</strong> point games with <strong>45</strong>, Most <strong>40</strong> point games in a season with <strong>63</strong>, Most consecutive <strong>50</strong> point games with <strong>7</strong> (spanning from December 16-29, 1961), Most consecutive <strong>40</strong> point games with <strong>14</strong> (spanning from December 8-30, and January 11 to February 1, 1962), Most consecutive <strong>30</strong> point games with <strong>65</strong> (spanning from November 4, 1961 to February 22, 1962), Most consecutive <strong>20</strong> point games with <strong>126</strong> (spanning from October 19, 1961 to January 19, 1963), Most consecutive games leading all players in scoring with <strong>40</strong> games in the 1961-62 season, Most field goals made in a season with <strong>1,597</strong> in 1961-62, Most field goals attempted in a season with <strong>3,159</strong> in 1961-62, Most free throws attempted in a season with <strong>1,363</strong> in 1961-62, Most field goal attempts in a game with <strong>48</strong> (against the Syracuse Nationals on March 22, 1962), Most field goal attempts in a five-game series with <strong>159</strong> (against the Syracuse Nationals in 1962), Free throw attempts in a game with <strong>16</strong> in 1962, Most minutes played in a season with <strong>3,882</strong> in 1961-62, Most minutes played per game for a season with <strong>48.53</strong> in 1961-62, Most complete games in a season with <strong>79</strong> out of <strong>80</strong> games in 1961-62, Most consecutive complete games in a season with <strong>47</strong> in 1961-62, and the Most points scored in a single season with a total of <strong>4,029</strong> in 1961-62. Wilt's <strong>4,029</strong> regular-season point total made him the only player to break the <strong>4,000</strong> point mark. Chamberlain would also once again break the <strong>2,000</strong> rebound mark with <strong>2,052</strong>. Chamberlain would also go on to score <strong>42</strong> points in the NBA All-Star game that season, which was a record at the time, but has sense been broken. 
                    
                    Chamberlain's Warriors would meet the Celtics once more in the playoffs that season. A Celtic team that both Bob Cousy and Bill Russell deemed the greatest Celtic team of all-time. Each team would win their games on their home floor, so the series would be split at three, after six games. In a heavily contested seventh game, Chamberlain would go on to tie the game at <strong>107</strong> with only <strong>16</strong> seconds remaining. However, Celtic guard Sam Jones had other plans, as he would hit a clutch shot with only <strong>2</strong> seconds left to win the series for Boston. In the coming years, Chamberlain would often face a lot of criticism for averaging <strong>50</strong> points for a season, as many saw it as selfish to score that much, and even with his extreme average of points, he didn't win the title, so people also used that to criticize Chamberlain. Coming to Chamberlain's defense was coach McGuire who stated that "Wilt has been simply super-human" and proceeded to comment on how the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer, a playmaker, and a second center or forward to take pressure off of Chamberlain.

                <p>
                    Heading into the 1962-63 NBA Season, Chamberlain's Warriors would move their franchise from Philadelphia to San Francisco, now becoming the San Francisco Warriors. Due to the location change, some of Wilt's teammates decided to leave the team. The superstar and future Hall of Famer Paul Arizin decided to retire, rather than move away from his family and job position at IBM (International Business Machines Corporations) in Philadelphia. Tom Gola would request a trade to the New York Knicks as he was homesick. And even the Warriors coach Frank McGuire decided to resign, rather than move to the West Coast. With the loss of both secondary scorers, Chamberlain would continue his array of statistical feats, as he would average <strong>44.8</strong> points and <strong>24.3</strong> rebounds per game during that year. Despite Chamberlain's individual success, the Warriors would lose <strong>49</strong> out of their <strong>80</strong> games and would miss the playoffs.

                <h3>1963-64 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Chamberlains next NBA season would be his last in a Warriors uniform (1963-64). The Warriors would receive a new coach by the name of Alex Hannum, to go alongside a promising rookie and future Hall of Fame Center, Nate Thurmond. Hannum was an ex-soldier, who would later on be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach. Hannum was known to be a crafty psychologist who often emphasized defense and passing. Unlike other coaches, Hannum wasn't afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain, who had grown a reputation for not communicating with coaches he did not like. With the twin towers of the 7'1 Wilt Chamberlain and the 6'11 Nate Thurmond, Chamberlain would average <strong>36.9</strong> points and <strong>22.3</strong> rebounds per game. The Warriors would also avenge themselves from the previous season as they would make the playoffs, but that was only the start of it. Chamberlain and Thurmond's Warriors would be set to verse the <strong>46-34</strong> St. Louis Hawks (whose regular season record was the 2nd best in the Western Division, behind the Warriors, and the Hawks had the 4th best record in the league). This series would be an epic 7 game series as the Hawks would take games 1, 3, and 6. The Warriors would take games 2, 4, 5, and the deciding game 7, which earned them a spot in the NBA Finals, representing the Western Division. This would be Chamberlain's first NBA Finals appearance and waiting for them was the Boston Celtics. The experienced Boston Celtics made quick work of the Warriors as they beat them 4 games to 1, giving Chamberlain his first finals loss of his career. During the summer of 1964, Chamberlain would be one of the prominent participants at the famed Rucker Park basketball court, located in New York City. While there, Chamberlain would make the acquaintance of a tall and talented 17-year-old who played there, whose name was Lew Alcindor (who would later be known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The young Alcindor was soon welcomed into Chamberlain's inner circle and would quickly idolize Chamberlain, who was only 10 years older than him. These two figures would develop an intense rivalry later in Chamberlain's playing career.

                <h3>1964-65 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    The 1964-65 season would arrive and the NBA would widen the lane from <strong>12 feet</strong> to <strong>16 feet</strong>, due to centers like Chamberlain. This was in an attempt to slow Chamberlain down, which ultimately did little to nothing in slowing down the dominant Chamberlain. The Warriors would get off to a terrible start to the season and would run into financial trouble. At the 1965 All-Star Weekend, Chamberlain would be traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, where he would spend the next 3 seasons of his career. Even though Chamberlain was from Philadelphia, this would be the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals, who were former rivals of Chamberlain. Chamberlain did not care for the coach Dolph Schayes because in his view, Schayes had made a multitude of disrespectful remarks when they were rival players. In the Chamberlain trade to the 76ers, the Warriors would receive Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, and Lee Shaffer, who would opt to retire rather than play for the Warriors. The 76ers also received an additional <strong>$150,000</strong>. Chamberlain would be offered a <strong>$100,000</strong> contract, which made him at the time, the highest paid athlete in the world. Chamberlains rival Bill Russell was obviously annoyed by this so he went to the Celtic's front office and demanded to be paid <strong>$1</strong> more than Chamberlain or else he would consider retirement. The Celtic's obviously granted Russell's wish and gave him a <strong>$100,001</strong> contract, which now made him the highest paid athlete in the world at the time. Waiting for Chamberlain in Philadelphia included veteran shooting guard Hal Greer, who would become a future Hall of Famer, to go alongside with a set of talented role players which included point guard Larry Costello, small forward Chet Walker, and centers Johnny "Red" Kerr and Lucious Jackson. The team also featured an All-Rookie forward and future Hall of Famer Billy Cunningham in the new sixth man role. Of course there would be some tension with the team as Hal Greer was the formerly undisputed leader of the team and wasn't willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, who was a talented center, was now forced into playing the power forward position as Chamberlain would occupy the center spot. However, as the season progressed, these three would begin to mesh better. From a statistical standpoint, Chamberlain was nothing but outstanding as he averaged <strong>34.7</strong> points and <strong>22.9</strong> rebounds per game for the course of the season. Future Georgetown coach John Thompson, who at the time was a rookie for the Boston Celtics would elbow Chamberlain in the face and would broke Chamberlain's nose, causing Chamberlain to wear a face mask in several games. The 76ers would make the playoffs and they would defeat the Cincinnati Royals, who were led by Chamberlain fellow All-American Oscar Robertson. The 76ers would then meet a familiar rival of Chamberlain, the Boston Celtics, in the Eastern Division Finals. This series would go on to 7 games as the two teams would split the first six games of the series and the deciding game 7 would be held in the Boston Garden, due to Boston having a better season record. In that deciding game 7, Chamberlain logged <strong>30</strong> points and <strong>32</strong> rebounds, compared to Russell who put up <strong>16</strong> points, <strong>27</strong> rebounds, and <strong>8</strong> assists. This game would go down to final minute as Chamberlain would hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell, which brought Boston's lead down to <strong>110-109</strong> with <strong>5</strong> seconds left (Chamberlain scored the last <strong>10</strong> points, the tenth coming from his slam dunk on Russell). Russell would take the ball out of bounds to inbound it and as he threw the ball in, it would hit a guy-wire supporting the backboard, which then caused the ball to bounce back out of bounds, which gave the possession of the ball to the 76ers. Coach Schayes would call a timeout and determined that it would be unwise to pass the ball into Chamberlain, as he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him. With the 76ers ready to inbound the ball underneath their basket, Red Kerr would set a pick on Sam Jones, which left Chet Walker free and wide open. As Greer attempted to inbound the ball to Walker, John Havlicek stole the ball to secure the Celtics' lead. This would mark the <strong>5th</strong> time in seven years where Russell's team had deprived Chamberlain of the title. According to Chamberlain himself, this was the time that people started calling him a loser. In an issue of Sports Illustrated in April of 1965 titled "My Life in a Bush League", Chamberlain conducted an interview where he would criticize his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain would later comment that he could see in hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image.

                <h3>1965-66 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 1965-66 NBA season, the 76ers would put up a <strong>55-25</strong> regular-season record, as Chamberlain would go on to win his second MVP award. During that season, Chamberlain once again dominated his compettition by averaging <strong>33.5</strong> points and <strong>24.6</strong> rebounds per Game, which led the league in both categories. During a particular game, Chamberlain would block a dunk attempt by Gus Johnson (a player for the Baltimore Bullets) so hard that he dislocated Johnson's shoulder. Off the court, Chamberlain's commitment to the team was doubted, as Chamberlain was a late sleeper, lived in New York City, as he preferred to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there, and he was only available during the afternoon for training. Due to Schayes not wanting to risk upsetting his best player, he would schedule the daily workout at 4 pm. This would anger the team, as they preferred an earlier schedule in order to have the afternoon off. Irv Kosloff, who owned the 76ers alone after Ike Richman's death (Richman was the original co-owner of the 76ers, as well as Chamberlain's confidant and lawyer, died of a heart attack while attending a road game in Boston), pleaded with Wilt to move to Philadelphia during the season, but was ultimately turned down. The 76ers would make it to the playoffs and would once again meet the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals. For the first time, the 76ers would have home-court advantage. Boston would win the first two games on the road, winning <strong>115-96</strong> and <strong>114-93</strong>; while Chamberlain would play within his usual range, as his supporting cast shot under <strong>40%</strong>. In game 3, Chamberlain scored <strong>31</strong> points and grabbed <strong>27</strong> rebounds for the road win. In game 4, Boston would win <strong>114-108</strong>. In game 5, Chamberlain would score <strong>46</strong> points and grabbed <strong>34</strong> rebounds, but it wasn't enough as Boston won the game <strong>120-112</strong> and the series. After yet another loss, Chamberlain's teammates confronted him about his selfish, unprofessional, and egotistical behavior and how it set a bad example for his teammates.

                <h3>1966-67 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Prior to the 1966-67 NBA season, Schayes would be replaced by a familiar face, Alex Hannum. During a locker room meeting with the team, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the previous season, which several of them put Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. 76ers forward Walker testified that on several occasions, players would have to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart in order to prevent a fistfight. Cunningham would comment that Hannum "never backed down" and "showed who was the boss". Due to this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions had calmed down, Hannum said to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title but Chamberlain had to "act like a man" both on and off the court in order to pull this off. Concerning the basketball side of things, Hannum persuaded Chamberlain to change his style of play. With surrounding talent that could score, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to focus more on the defensive side of the ball. Kerr would be traded to the Baltimore Bullets for point guard Wali Jones, and shooting guard Matt Guokas would be selected in the first round of the 1966 NBA Draft.

                    Due to the change of style in Chamberlain's game, Chamberlain would average a career-low <strong>24.1</strong> points and only took <strong>14%</strong> of his team's shots, but was extremely efficient with a record-breaking <strong>.683</strong> field goal accuracy. Chamberlain led the league in rebounds with <strong>24.2</strong> per game, was third in assists <strong>7.8</strong>, and played strong defense. Chamberlain's efficiency during that season was reflected by a streak of 35 consecutive made field goals over the course of four games in February. Included in that stretch came a game against the Baltimore Bullets, where Chamberlain put up a triple double of <strong>42</strong> points, <strong>30</strong> rebounds, <strong>10</strong> assists, on <strong>100%</strong> shooting from the field as he made all <strong>18</strong> of his field goal attempts. For his feats that season, Chamberlain was awarded with his third MVP award. The 76ers finished the regular season with a then-record <strong>68-13</strong> season, including a record <strong>46-4</strong> start. Everything was clicking for Chamberlain and his teammates both on and off the floor that season. In the playoffs that year, the 76ers were set to battle the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals yet again and once more held home-court advantage. In game 1, the 76ers beat Boston <strong>127-112</strong>, thanks to Greer's <strong>39</strong> points and Chamberlain's unofficial quadruple double as he recorded <strong>24</strong> points, <strong>32</strong> rebounds, <strong>13</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> unofficially counted blocks. In game 2, the 76ers won once more <strong>107-102</strong> in overtime, and player-coach Bill Russell grudgingly praised Chamberlain for intimidating the Celtics into taking low percentage shots from further outside. In game 3, Chamberlain secured <strong>41</strong> rebounds and helped the 76ers win <strong>115-104</strong>, giving the 76ers a <strong>3-0</strong> series lead over Boston. However, Boston bounced back in game 4 with a <strong>121-117</strong> win, preventing the sweep. In game 5, the 76ers overpowered the Boston Celtics <strong>140-116</strong>, which ended Boston's historic run of 8 consecutive NBA titles. In that game, Chamberlain put up <strong>29</strong> points, <strong>36</strong> rebounds, and <strong>13</strong> assists, as well as receiving praise by both Bill Russell and K.C. Jones of the Boston Celtics. During that game, the Philadelphia fans chanted "Boston is dead" as the Celtics' 8-year reign as NBA champion had ended.

                    In the 1967 NBA Finals, which was Chamberlain's second finals appearance, the 76ers were pitted against Chamberlain's former team, the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors were led by two future Hall-of-Famers in the star forward Rick Barry and Chamberlain's one-time backup center Nate Thurmond. The 76ers would win the first two games, with both Chamberlain and Greer receiving credit for defense and clutch shooting, respectively, but San Francisco would bounce back and win two of the next three games, so Philadelphia was up <strong>3-2</strong> prior to game 6. In game 6, the Warriors would be trailing <strong>123-122</strong> with <strong>15</strong> seconds left. For the last play, Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and Walker. However, the 76ers foiled it due to Walker holding up Thurmond's ability to roll, and Barry would instead be picked up by Chamberlain, making it impossible to shoot. By the time Barry had made his move, Walker had recovered back to Barry, who was stuck in the air and botched the shot. Jackson would then force a jump ball on the rebound, and the 76ers had won the championship, giving Wilt his first championship title. Chamberlain had averaged <strong>17.7</strong> points and <strong>28.7</strong> rebounds per game against Thurmond in those six games. Chamberlain would go on to say that "It is wonderful to be a part of the greatest team in basketball ... being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you." This 76ers team has been ranked as one of the best in NBA history.

                <h3>1967-68 Season</h3>

                    In the 1967-68 NBA season, Chamberlain and Kosloff's relationship would continue to turn sour. In 1965, Chamberlain said that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give him <strong>25%</strong> of the franchise once he ended his career. Although there was no written proof for or against, Schayes and the 76ers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was correct. Kosloff would decline the request, which left Chamberlain extremely livid and willing to join the rival American Basketball Association (ABA) once his contract ended in 1967. Kosloff and Chamberlain would work out a mutual agreement, and later signed a one-year, <strong>$250,000</strong> contract.

                    On the court, Chamberlain continued to focus on team play and logged <strong>24.3</strong> points and <strong>23.8</strong> rebounds per game that season. The best part of his season came on March 18, 1968, in a <strong>158-138</strong> win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Chamberlain led his team with <strong>53</strong> points, <strong>32</strong> rebounds, <strong>14</strong> assists, <strong>11</strong> steals, and <strong>24</strong> blocks on <strong>82.8%</strong> from the field, giving him the unforeseen quintuple-double. In the entire history of the NBA, no one has ever officially achieved such a feat. Chamberlain's blocks and steals were tracked by Harvey Pollack, who was a respected statistician who would later go on to make the Basketball Hall-Of-Fame. Harvey worked in the NBA for a total of <strong>69</strong> seasons, until his death in <strong>2015</strong>. In that game, Chamberlain also put up the most points in a triple double at the time. Another highlight performance came only a month earlier as Chamberlain recorded the first <strong>20-20-20</strong> game (the double triple-double) as on February 2, 1968, in a <strong>131-121</strong> victory over the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain recorded <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and <strong>21</strong> assists, giving him the first <strong>20-20-20</strong> game in NBA history. Fun fact: This wasn't the first <strong>20-20-20</strong> game Chamberlain had in his career. The <strong>20-20-20</strong> game he had in 1968 was the first official <strong>20-20-20</strong> game. However, during Chamberlains 1961-62 season, he had a game against the Chicago Packers where he recorded <strong>34</strong> points, <strong>33</strong> rebounds, <strong>4</strong> assists, and <strong>20</strong> blocks to lead the Warriors to a <strong>119-115</strong> victory. Due to the league not counting blocks as official statistics yet, this game didn't officially count as a double triple-double game, but Chamberlains blocks were counted by Harvey Pollack. The <strong>20-20-20</strong> game record would remain his until Russell Westbrook achieved the same feat in 2019. Chamberlain's 76ers had the best record in the league for the third straight season. Chamberlain also made history by becoming the first and only center in NBA history to finish the season as the leader in assists, his <strong>702</strong> total assists beating out runner-up point guard and future Hall-Of-Famer Lenny Wilkens' total by <strong>23</strong>. Wilt had also felt that he had dispelled the myth that he could not and would not pass the ball. For these accomplishments, Chamberlain won his fourth and final MVP (3rd consecutive MVP). Chamberlain also hit a landmark of reaching his <strong>25,000th</strong> point, which made him the first-ever player to score that many points. With the 76ers winning a total of <strong>62</strong> games, they easily took the number 1 seed in the playoffs. In the Eastern Division Semifinals, the 76ers were matched up with the New York Knicks. In a physically tough matchup, the 76ers would lose their sixth man in Cunningham with a broken hand, and Chamberlain, Greer, and Jackson were struggling with inflamed feet, bad knees, and pulled hamstrings. The 76ers would have a <strong>3-2</strong> series lead and would close out the series in game 6 with a final score of <strong>115-97</strong> as Chamberlain contributed <strong>25</strong> points, and <strong>27</strong> rebounds. Chamberlain had a successful series he led both teams in points (<strong>153</strong>), rebounds (<strong>145</strong>), and assists (<strong>38</strong>).

                    The 76ers found themselves once again matched up with the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals, while also having home-court advantage once more and as the reigning champions. On April 4, a national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. With eight of the ten starting players on the 76ers and Celtics being African-American, both teams were in extreme shock, and there were calls to even cancel the series. In a game deemed "unreal" and "devoid of emotion", the 76ers lost <strong>127-118</strong> on April 5. In game 2, Philadelphia would tie the series with a <strong>115-106</strong> victory, and would go on to win games 3 and 4 as well, with Chamberlain suspiciously often played by the Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, to cause the press to speculate that Russell was worn down. This victory would put the 76ers up <strong>3-1</strong> in the series. Prior to game 5, the 76ers seemed destined to win the series, as no NBA team had overcome a <strong>3-1</strong> deficit before. However, the Celtics shook the basketball world as they rallied back, winning the next two games <strong>122-104 and 114-106</strong>, respectively, as they were powered by an energetic John Havlicek, to go along with the 76ers bad shooting in those games. In the deciding game 7, <strong>15,202</strong> stunned Philadelphia fans would witness a <strong>100-96</strong> defeat for the 76ers, which would mark the first time in NBA history that a team would go on to lose the series after initially leading <strong>3-1</strong>. In the decisive game 7, the 76ers shot badly (Greer, Jones, Walker, Jackson, and Guokas hit a combined <strong>25 of 74</strong> shots), while Chamberlain grabbed <strong>34</strong> rebounds and shot <strong>4-of-9</strong> for a total of <strong>14</strong> points. In the second half of game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point that was conceded by Hannum.

                    With the loss of yet another game 7 to the Celtics, Chamberlain now had an awful <strong>1-6</strong> record in playoff series against Boston. After the conclusion of the season, coach Hannum wanted to be closer to his family on the West Coast, so he left the 76ers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the recently founded ABA. Chamberlain would then request a trade and 76ers general manager Jack Ramsay would trade him to the Los Angeles Lakers, a place where Chamberlain could enjoy the twilight years of his legendary career. The deal sent Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. The motivation for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist who was close with the Lakers organization, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Chamberlain-Richman deal. According to Ramsay, Chamberlain threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left and forced the trade. There were several other reasons for this move, among those was the fact that Chamberlain felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities, which were plenty in Los Angeles, and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in Los Angeles but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.

                    On July 9, 1968, the trade between the Los Angeles Lakers and the 76ers was completed, making it the first time a reigning NBA MVP was traded the next season. The Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract, paying him <strong>$250,000</strong> after taxes, or about <strong>$1.9 million</strong> in real value; in comparison, previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid <strong>$100,000</strong> before taxes (about <strong>$780,000</strong> in real value).

                <h3>1968-69 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    For the 1968-69 NBA season, Chamberlain would be joining a squad that featured his former All-American and future Hall-Of-Famer, forward Elgin Baylor to go along with the future Hall-Of-Fame guard Jerry West. With those two, the Laker's roster featured backup center Mel Counts, forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins, and a talented 5'11 guard Johnny Egan. Chamberlain signing with the Lakers would be considered the first NBA team in league history to be considered a super team as the roster now featured <strong>3</strong> future Hall-of-Famers on the roster. On paper, this team seemed destined for nothing short of a championship, but the main thing that held them back was their timing. At the time of the Chamberlain signing, Baylor was already <strong>34</strong> years old and Jerry West was <strong>30</strong> years old. Chamberlain would initially struggle to fit in with the team. Even though he was on good terms with West, Chamberlain often argued with the team captain Elgin Baylor, even though they were good friends.

                    Due to the lack of a second guard next to West, and the lack of speed and quickness, would concern coach Butch van Breda Kolff. The team lost Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 NBA expansion draft. However, the greatest problem in the Lakers organization came from the tense relationship between Chamberlain and Van Breda Kolff. Kolff pejoratively called the new recruit "The Load", as he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, slacked too often in practice, and rather focused too much on his own statistics. Chamberlain would describe Van Breda Kolff as "the dumbest and worst coach ever". Erickson commented that "Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry ... and that is not a good way to get on Wilt's side ... that relationship was doomed from the start."

                    Chamberlain would experience an often-frustrating season. Van Breda Kolff would bench him several times, which never happened in his career before; in mid-season, Chamberlain, a perennial scoring champion, had two games in which he scored only <strong>6</strong> and then only <strong>2</strong> points. Despite playing through a multitude of his problems, Chamberlain would average <strong>20.5</strong> points and <strong>21.1</strong> rebounds a game during that season. Cooke would be pleased as ticket sales went up by <strong>11%</strong> since the acquisition of Chamberlain. The Lakers overall finished with a <strong>55-27</strong> record, finishing <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Western Division, and tied for <strong>2nd</strong> place in the entire league for their team record.

                    As the first seed in the West, the Lakers would be matched up with Chamberlain's former team, the San Francisco Warriors. However, the Lakers dispatched them <strong>4-2</strong>, after initially losing the first two games. The Lakers then easily handled the Atlanta Hawks in the Western Division Finals, winning the series <strong>4-1</strong>. Heading into the NBA finals, and they would be set to verse the Boston Celtics once more. Heading into that NBA finals as <strong>3-to-1</strong> favorites, the Lakers would secure the first two games, then drop the next two games. Chamberlain would be criticized as a non-factor in the series, often being outplayed by Russell, with minimal effort. In game 5, Chamberlain logged <strong>13</strong> points and secured <strong>31</strong> rebounds as he led the Lakers to a <strong>117-104</strong> victory. In game 6, Chamberlain secured <strong>18</strong> rebounds, dished out <strong>4</strong> assists, and only scored a total of <strong>8</strong> points, as the Celtics won with a final score of <strong>99-90</strong>.
                    
                    Game 7 would roll around, which would feature a surreal sight as Cooke put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles, in anticipation of a Lakers win. This display of such arrogance would motivate the Celtics. In game 7, the Lakers would find themselves trailing <strong>91-76</strong> after <strong>3</strong> quarters of play. The Lakers would mount a comeback, however Chamberlain would then twist his ankle after going for a rebound and had to be replaced by Mel Counts. With only three minutes to go, the Lakers trailed <strong>103-102</strong>, but they would commit several costly turnovers and lost the game <strong>108-106</strong>, despite a triple-double performance from West, who put up <strong>42</strong> points, <strong>13</strong> rebounds, and <strong>12</strong> assists, achieving the first ever recorded triple-double in a game 7 of the NBA finals in league history. West would also be named the NBA's first Finals MVP award, despite playing for the losing side, to which he is still the only player in NBA history to win the Finals MVP while playing for the losing side.

                    After the game, many wondered why Chamberlain sat out the final six minutes. At the time of his final substitution, he had scored <strong>18</strong> points (hitting <strong>7</strong> of his <strong>8</strong> shots) and grabbed <strong>27</strong> rebounds, significantly better than the <strong>10</strong> points of Counts on <strong>4-of-13</strong> shooting. Among others, Russell did not believe Chamberlain's injury was grave and accused him of being an exaggerator, stating "Any injury short of a broken leg or a broken back is not enough."
                    
                    In spite of their earlier quarrels, Van Breda Kolff came to his defense, insisting the often-maligned Chamberlain hardly was able to move in the end. Van Breda Kolff was perceived as "pig-headed" for benching Chamberlain and soon resigned as Lakers coach.

                <h3>1969-70 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    At the start of the 1969-70 NBA season, Chamberlain would be coached under a new face in Joe Mullaney, as he strongly started off the season averaging <strong>32.2</strong> points and <strong>20.6</strong> rebounds per game over the course of the first nine games of the season. During the ninth game of the season, Chamberlain would suffer a serious knee injury, as he ruptured the patellar tendon at the base of his right kneecap. He would then miss the next several months before making his return for the final three games of the 82-game regular season, which was the first season in which Chamberlain failed to reach <strong>20</strong> rebounds per game. Thanks to his strong start to the year, Chamberlain put up averages of <strong>27.3</strong> points, <strong>18.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4.1</strong> assists per game. Jerry West would lead the league and the Lakers in points per game as he averaged <strong>31.2</strong> points per game, to go along with <strong>4.6</strong> rebounds and <strong>7.5</strong> assists, leading the Lakers in assists per game and total assists for the year. Elgin Baylor contributed a solid <strong>24.0</strong> points, <strong>10.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>5.4</strong> assists on the season. And the Lakers 27-year-old guard Happy Hairston chipped in <strong>20.6</strong> points, <strong>12.5</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.0</strong> assists. 
                    
                    The Lakers as a whole would finish the regular season with a <strong>46-36</strong> record, which placed them <strong>2nd</strong> in the Western Division and <strong>5th</strong> overall in the league. Through the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Phoenix suns in <strong>7</strong> games, swept the Hawks in the Western Division Finals, before they would be matched up with the <strong>60-22</strong> New York Knicks in the NBA Finals. In game 6 in the series against the Suns, Chamberlain recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>26</strong> rebounds, <strong>11</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocked shots. The Knicks were stacked with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave Debusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt "Clyde" Frazier. Due to the loss of Chamberlain's lateral quickness because of his injury, Chamberlain would often find himself too slow to block Reed's preferred high-post jump shots. In game 1, the Knicks came away with a <strong>124-112</strong> win in which Reed scored <strong>37</strong> points, while Chamberlain only put up <strong>17</strong> points. In game 2, Chamberlain scored <strong>19</strong> points, grabbed <strong>24</strong> rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds of the game, leading the Lakers to a <strong>105-103</strong> victory. In game 3, Jerry West would hit an iconic <strong>60-foot</strong> shot as the clock expired, which tied the game at <strong>102</strong>. However, the Knicks pulled away with the win <strong>111-108</strong>. In game 4, Chamberlain put up <strong>18</strong> points, secured <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and helped to tie the series at <strong>2</strong> a piece. In game 5, as the Knicks were trailing by double digits, Reed would pull his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series. With Reed now sidelined, Chamberlain was expected to take full advantage of the Knicks smaller backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket Jr., or forwards Bill Bradley and Dave Debusschere, who gave up more than a half a foot against him. However, the Lakers would give away their <strong>13-point</strong> halftime lead and would succumb to the aggressive Knicks defense, as they committed a total of <strong>19</strong> second-half turnovers, and the two main scorers (which were Chamberlain and West) shot the ball in the entire second half only <strong>3</strong> and <strong>2</strong> times, respectively. The Lakers would lose the game <strong>107-100</strong> in what has been deemed as one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In game 6, Chamberlain scored <strong>45</strong> points, grabbed <strong>27</strong> rebounds, and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a <strong>135-113</strong> Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to game 7 in New York City. However, the hero of that game 7 was Reed, who would famously hobble up the court, scored the first <strong>4</strong> points. This inspired the Knicks to cause one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time. The Knicks would lead by <strong>27</strong> at the halftime mark, and despite scoring <strong>21</strong> points, Chamberlain could not prevent a third consecutive loss in game 7. Chamberlain would be criticized for his inability to dominate his injured counterpart.

                <h3>1970-71 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    During the 1970-71 NBA season, the Lakers made a significant acquisition by signing the future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who had returned back from the Suns after playing for the Lakers until 1968. For that season, Chamberlain would put up solid numbers of <strong>20.7</strong> points, <strong>18.2</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4.3</strong> assists, as he once again led the NBA in rebounding. The Lakers would finish that season with a <strong>48-34</strong>, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Pacific Division and tied for <strong>4th</strong> overall in the league (this would be the year the league split up the teams into 4 seperate divisions which included the Atlantic, Central, Midwest, and Pacific Divisions). After the loss of Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture, and West after a knee injury, the short-staffed Lakers were viewed as underdogs in the playoffs verse the Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by their reigning MVP in Lew Alcindor, and by veteran future Hall-Of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson, who they would face in the Western Conference Finals (the league changed from divisions to conferences). With Milwaukee winning <strong>66</strong> games, the Bucks were viewed as the favorites against the short-staffed Lakers. However, many spectators were looking forward to the matchup between the <strong>34-year-old</strong> Chamberlain and the <strong>24-year-old</strong> Alcindor.

                    In game 1, Alcindor would outscore Chamberlain <strong>32-22</strong>, and the Bucks would win the game <strong>106-85</strong>. In game 2, the Bucks would win once more, despite the <strong>26</strong> point performance from Chamberlain, which was four more than his counterpart. Prior to game 3, things would worsen for the Lakers team as Erickson, who was West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season. With the Lakers rookie small forward Jim McMillian, he eased the scoring pressure, as Chamberlain scored <strong>24</strong> points and secured <strong>24</strong> rebounds in a <strong>118-107</strong> winning effort. But the Bucks would bounce back and would defeat the Lakers <strong>117-94</strong> in game 4, to take a commanding <strong>3-1</strong> series lead. Milwaukee would then close out the series in game 5 at home with a <strong>116-98</strong> victory. Despite the loss, Chamberlain was praised for holding his own against the MVP Alcindor, who was not only <strong>10</strong> years younger, but also healthy. The Bucks would go on to win the NBA Finals by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets.

                <h3>1971-72 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    The 1971-72 season would prove to be quite the year for Chamberlain and the Lakers. For starters, the Lakers hired former Celtic star Bill Sharman as their head coach. Sharman would completely change the course this team was heading down. Sharman would introduce morning shoot-arounds, which the common latecomer Chamberlain would regularly participate in, contrary to his earlier years with Schayes. Sharman also transitioned Chamberlain into a defensive-minded, low-scoring post defender as the Lakers had plenty of scoring options surrounding Chamberlain, so Sharman had Chamberlain focus on rebounding and defense. On top of that, Sharman told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills in order to trigger fastbreaks to his teammates. Seeing how effective the fastbreak style of ball was during his playing career, Sharman wanted replicate that style for this Lakers offense. With no longer being a main scorer, Chamberlain would be named the new captain of the Lakers. The Lakers got off to a bumpy <strong>6-3</strong> start to the season, as the Lakers weren't used to running the fastbreak, and due to Baylor not being able to get up and down the court as fast, because of his ruptured Achilles tendon. Sharman would approach Baylor and ask him if we wanted to give his starters minutes to some of the younger Laker players, while he could come off the bench in a reduced role for the team. However, Baylor took this as a sign that he couldn't play the game as good as he used to, so he ended up retiring on the spot, only <strong>9</strong> games into the season. This left a void that Chamberlain needed to fill. Originally, Sharman wanted both West and Chamberlain to share the responsibility of running the fastbreak, but West would decline, as he stated how he was injury prone and wanted to solely focus on the game. Chamberlain accepted his new role in the Lakers system and would put up an all-time low <strong>14.8</strong> points per game, while also posting <strong>19.2</strong> rebounds per game, which led the league. Chamberlain also led the league in field goal percentage <strong>64.9%</strong>. Baylor would be replaced by the much younger and explosive scorer Jim McMillian in the starting rotation. With Jim McMillian starting at the small forward position, the Lakers starting lineup saw Jerry West and Gail Goodrich at the guard positions, Jim McMillian at small forward, Happy Hairston at power forward, and the still lethal and dominant Wilt Chamberlain at the center position. What turned out to be a setback actually turned out to be a blessing for the Lakers as when Baylor departed from the team, the Lakers would begin their legendary <strong>33</strong> game winning streak, with the help of Chamberlain's defensive presence, which is an all time record that still stands today. The Lakers would finish the season with a then-record <strong>69</strong> wins in the regular season, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in both the Pacific Division and in the entire league. The Lakers starting shooting guard and future Hall-of-Famer Gail Goodrich would lead the team in scoring with <strong>25.9</strong> points per game. Jerry West would lead the Lakers and the league in assists with <strong>9.7</strong> per game, while also putting up <strong>25.8</strong> points and <strong>4.2</strong> rebounds per game. Jim McMillian would contribute <strong>18.8</strong> points, <strong>6.5</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.6</strong> assists per game that season and the Lakers Happy Hairston would chip in <strong>13.1</strong> points, <strong>13.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.4</strong> assists. Chamberlain would also be placed on the All-Defensive 1st Team this season, and would make the All-NBA 2nd Team. And as a fun fact, the league changed its logo to a Jerry West image, while he was still playing in the league. One of the Lakers standout performances during the regular season came on March 19, when the Lakers defeated the <strong>49-30</strong> Golden State Warriors by an enormous <strong>63</strong> points.

                    In the playoffs that season, the Lakers swept the Chicago Bulls, then went on to verse the Milwaukee Bucks and their MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly known as Lew Alcindor). According to Life (an American magazine brand), the matchup between Chamberlain and Kareem would be the greatest matchup in all of sports. Despite the series going to six hard fought games, Chamberlain would help to lead the Lakers past Kareem and the Bucks. Over the course of the six games verse Milwaukee, Chamberlain put up <strong>10.8</strong> points, <strong>19.3</strong> rebounds, and <strong>3.3</strong> assists, on <strong>45.2%</strong> shooting from the field, and <strong>44.3%</strong> from the free throw line. Jim McMillian would lead the team in scoring in the series and West would lead in total assists. Chamberlain was especially for his contributions in game 6, where he logged <strong>24</strong> points and secured <strong>22</strong> rebounds, while playing all <strong>48</strong> minutes that game, and even outsprinted the younger Kareem on several late Lakers fast breaks. The Lakers would win the game and the series with a final score of <strong>104-100</strong>. Jerry West would call it "the greatest ball-busting performance I have ever seen". Due to Chamberlain performing so well in the series, Time (an American News magazine) stated "In the N.B.A.'s western division title series with Milwaukee, he (Chamberlain) decisively outplayed basketball's newest giant superstar, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, eleven years his junior."

                    The Lakers would then be set to verse the New York Knicks once more in the NBA Finals. The Knicks were a team that was severely short-staffed as they had lost the 6'9 Reed to an injury, and the undersized 6'8 Jerry Lucas was given the task in guarding the 7'1 giant that was Wilt Chamberlain. With the prolific outside shooting from Lucas, the Knicks would win the first game, as Lucas hit <strong>9</strong> out of his <strong>11</strong> shots in the first half alone. In game 2, the Lakers pulled away with the win <strong>106-92</strong>, as Chamberlain put Lucas into foul trouble, and the Knicks would lose defensive power forward Dave Debusschere to an injury. In game 3, Chamberlain logged <strong>26</strong> points and grabbed <strong>20</strong> rebounds to win the Lakers another game. In a tough fought game 4, Chamberlain would be playing with <strong>5</strong> fouls late in the game. Chamberlain had never fouled out of a game in his career, which was a feat that he was extremely proud of. Despite the risk of fouling out, Chamberlain continued to play aggressive defense and would block <strong>2</strong> of Lucas' shots in overtime, which proved those wrong who stated how he only played for his own statistics, as Chamberlain ended up scoring a game-high of <strong>27</strong> points. During that game, Chamberlain fell on his right hand and was said to have sprained it, but in reality, it was actually broken. For game 5, Chamberlain was given thick pads for his hands (which were normally designed for defensive lineman in football). Chamberlain was also offered a painkilling shot, but he refused, as he feared he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb. During game 5, Chamberlain recorded a statline of <strong>24</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>8</strong> assists, and <strong>8</strong> blocked shots (which were counted by announcer Keith Jackson, during the game broadcast). Officially speaking, blocks and steals weren't counted as an NBA statistic at the time and would not be officially counted until the season after Chamberlain retired in 1973. However there is reported data that accounted for blocked shots in a total of 112 games played by Chamberlain. According to the data shown, Chamberlain averaged <strong>8.8</strong> blocks per game in those 112 games that recorded his blocks. Due to Chamberlain's all-around performance, the Lakers would win their first ever championship in Los Angeles with a <strong>114-100</strong> victory. Chamberlain would be named the NBA Finals MVP, and would be admired for overpowering the Knicks in game 5, while he was playing injured.

                <h3>1972-73 Season (Conclusion Season)</h3>
                <p>
                    The 1972-73 NBA season would mark the end of Chamberlain's playing career, although Chamberlain did not know this would be his last season at the time. During Chamberlains last season, the Lakers would lose their momentum as Happy Hairston went down with an injury, role players Flynn Robinson and LeRoy Ellis would leave, and the veteran Jerry West was struggling with injury. On the season, Chamberlain averaged <strong>13.2</strong> points and <strong>18.6</strong> rebounds, which was enough to win the rebounding title for the <strong>11th</strong> time in his career. On top of that, Chamberlain shot an NBA record of <strong>72.7%</strong> from the field, which topped his mark of <strong>68.3%</strong> from the 1966-67 NBA regular-season. This would mark the <strong>9th</strong> time in Chamberlains career where he would lead the league in field goal percentage. The Lakers would go on to win <strong>60</strong> games in the regular season, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Pacific Division, and tied them for the <strong>2nd</strong> best overall record in the league that season. Chamberlain would be named to his final All-Star team during this season as well. Chamberlain would once again be voted to the All-Defensive 1st Team.

                    Through the playoffs that season, the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls in <strong>7</strong> games in the Western Conference Semifinals, then the Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors (renamed from San Francisco) in <strong>5</strong> games in the Western Conference Finals. Waiting for them in the NBA Finals was the New York Knicks. However, the Knicks now had Willis Reed fully healthy, which would prove to be a problem for the Lakers who had several injuries. In that series, the Lakers would start off with a <strong>115-112</strong> victory, but the Knicks would bounce back by winning games 2 and 3. Things would continue to worsen for the Lakers when West injured his hamstring once again. In game 4, the short-staffed Lakers were absolutely no match for the fully healthy Knicks. In game 5, the injured Jerry West and Happy Hairston put up valiant efforts, but had bad games. The Lakers would lose this game <strong>102-93</strong> and the series <strong>3-2</strong>, even though Chamberlain scored <strong>23</strong> points, and securing <strong>21</strong> rebounds. After the Knicks had concluded the game with a last stretch led by then player Phil Jackson and future Hall-Of-Fame guard Earl "The Pearl" Monroe, Chamberlain would dunk the ball with <strong>1</strong> second left, which happened to be the last play of his NBA career.

                <h3>Wilt Chamberlain's Supreme Athleticism</h3>
                <p>
                    Before diving in to Wilt Chamberlain's inhuman like athleticism, it is important to note that Wilt has a case for being the greatest athlete in not just NBA history, but also in human history. While Wilt was still in high school, he got to display his amazing athletic abilities through track and field, as that was his original passion, before turning to Basketball. In high school, Wilt Chamberlain high jumped <strong>6 feet and 6 inches</strong>, he ran <strong>440 yards</strong> in <strong>49 seconds</strong>. His shotput was measured at <strong>53 feet and 4 inches</strong>, and Chamberlain would broad jumped <strong>22 feet</strong>. These measurements were incredibly impressive, considering the fact that these feats were achieved by a <strong>6 feet 11 inch</strong> high school student. Even when Wilt turned to Basketball, he would continue his track dominance while in college at Kansas University. While at Kansas, Wilt would run a <strong>40-yard</strong> dash in <strong>4.6</strong> seconds. According to eye witnesses, Wilt was barefoot in that sprint. To apply some more perspective into how impressive that is, LeBron James would run at that speed in 2012, which was when he was still in his prime, while in shoes. At an event, Wilt Chamberlain would be challenged by Hall of Famer NFL FB Jim Brown to a foot race. For those who don't know who that is, Jim Brown is considered one of, if not the greatest running back in NFL history. He was extremely effective in his role on the football field, as he was tasked with running with the football, which was something that he was the best at ever doing. According to those who witnessed the race, Wilt beat him comfortably in the foot race. Frustrated with the loss, Jim would challenege Wilt to a rematch, Wilt would accept and would beat him a second time. Wilt Chamberlain in college would be as fast, if not faster, than a prime LeBron James. Wilt would run a <strong>100-yard</strong> dash in <strong>10.9</strong> seconds, shot putted <strong>56 feet</strong>, triple jumped over <strong>50 feet</strong> and would go on to win the high jump in the Big 8 Track and Field Championships three years in a row. Wilt's teammates have said that Wilt could jump so high that he was able to grab quarters off the top of the backboard. Being able to do this as a man of his stature is something that is completely unheard of. Chamberlain was also known to be freakishly strong. On several different occasions people said they witnessed Wilt benchpress <strong>500</strong> pounds, however Wilt himself said he could do <strong>600</strong> pounds. Wilt could deadlift <strong>625</strong> pounds and clean-and-jerk nearly <strong>400</strong> pounds. Paul Silas, who was a former opponent of Chamberlain in the NBA recalled a time where Wilt Chamberlain picked him up and turned him around during a Basketball game. To put that in perspective, Paul was <strong>6 feet 7 inches</strong> tall and weighed <strong>235</strong> pounds. Bob Lanier, who was a <strong>6 foot and 10 inch</strong> center who weighed <strong>270</strong> pounds would be asked in a questionnaire about what was his most memorable moment of his career and Lanier would respond by recalling a time where Wilt Chamberlain picked him up and moved him like a coffee cup, in order to get into a favorable position on the court. If that isn't enough to put his athletic abilities into perspective, there was another quality that was touched upon before during the 1961-62 NBA season description. That was how Wilt Chamberlain averaged <strong>48.5</strong> minutes per game that season. Those are more minutes than there are in a standard <strong>48</strong> minute game. However, it was possible for Chamberlain to accomplish this due to the amount of overtime games he would play that season that would increase his minutes per game (to go along with the fact that he played in 79 complete games that season) just shows how much stamina he truly had. To add to Wilt's impressive athletic abilities, he also had a <strong>7 foot 8 inch</strong> wingspan. Wilt had the speed of Lebron James, more power than Shaquille O'Neal, and the ability to leap through the roof (and even a little bit higher) like a prime Russell Westbrook.

                <h3>Wilt Chamberlain's Career Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    When looking at the marvelous career of Wilt Chamberlain, it seems more like a myth than something that actually happened and people actually witnessed it take place. When purely looking at his NBA career, he was a <strong>4x League MVP, 13x All-Star, 7x All-NBA First Team, 3x All-NBA Second Team, 2x All-NBA Defensive First Team, 7x Scoring Champion, 11x Rebounding Champion, 1x Assist Champion, Rookie of the year winner, and a 1x All-Star Game MVP</strong>. Chamberlain was also a <strong>2x NBA Champion and a 1x NBA Finals MVP</strong>. Among those awards and honors, Wilt set and holds countless amounts of NBA records. His statistical dominance was nothing short of amazing, too amazing to seem real. Wilt was a walking statistical machine that could record stat lines that seem only possible in the realm of video games on a nightly basis. His quintuple-double game in 1968 speaks volumes as to what the man was capable of doing every night. The man was capable of recording and did record games where he achieved otherworldly numbers. On offense, Chamberlain was a walking <strong>40, 50, 60, and even 70</strong> point game. Chamberlain holds the record for the most <strong>40+</strong> point games in a season by a rookie in league history with <strong>32</strong>. The record for most consecutive <strong>40+</strong> point games also goes to Wilt Chamberlain with a stretch of <strong>14</strong> straight games, which came in the 1961-62 season. Chamberlain also holds the record for the second most consecutive <strong>40+</strong> point games in a season with <strong>10</strong> in the 1962-63 season. Chamberlain also holds the record for the most total <strong>40+</strong> point games in a career with <strong>271</strong> games. Chamberlain also held the record for most consecutive <strong>40+</strong> point games as a rookie with <strong>3</strong> in the 1959-60 season (Allen Iverson would break this record in his rookie season). To further emphasize his offensive abilities, Chamberlain holds the record for the most <strong>50+</strong> point games with <strong>118</strong>, which is nearly <strong>4</strong> times more than the second place holder, which is Michael Jordan with <strong>31</strong>. In a single season, Chamberlain recorded <strong>50+</strong> points <strong>45</strong> times during his legendary 1961-62 season. That means Chamberlain achieved more <strong>50+</strong> point games in <strong>1</strong> season, than Michael Jordan achieved in his whole career. If that isn't enough to show how dominant Chamberlain was, consider these next facts. Chamberlain holds the record for the most <strong>60+</strong> point games ever with <strong>32</strong> total. That means Chamberlain had more <strong>60+</strong> point games, than Michael Jordan had <strong>50+</strong> point games. Chamberlain holds the record with the most <strong>60+</strong> point games in a single season with <strong>15</strong>, which also came in 1961-62. Interestingly enough, Chamberlain also holds the second spot for the most <strong>60+</strong> point games in an NBA season with <strong>9</strong>, which he achieved in the 1962-63 season. The player who is in third place for the most <strong>60+</strong> points in a single NBA season is the current day Damian Lillard with a total of <strong>3</strong> in the 2019-2020 season. On top of that, Chamberlain holds the record for the most <strong>70+</strong> point games in a career, with only a total of <strong>6</strong> games. In the entire history of the league <strong>7</strong> other players have only scored at least 70 points once in their career. Those players being Elgin Baylor, David Thompson, Kobe Bryant, David Robinson, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Damian Lillard, all have only <strong>1 70+</strong> point game performance under their belt. Prior to the current 2022-23 NBA season, only <strong>5</strong> players had scored at least <strong>70+</strong> points in their playing career (each only having <strong>1</strong> time in which they achieved that feat) meaning that Chamberlain had more <strong>70+</strong> point games than the rest of the players in the entire history of the NBA combined. Chamberlain also holds the record for most points scored in a game by a rookie with <strong>58</strong> points (which he achieved twice). Chamberlain then also holds the record for the most points averaged by a rookie in NBA history with <strong>37.6</strong> points per game in his rookie season. On the other side of the ball, Chamberlain was arguably the greatest rebounder ever. Chamberlain holds the record for the most rebounds in a game with <strong>55</strong> (against his rival and elite rebounder Bill Russell), along with the most rebounds of all-time with a total of <strong>23,924</strong> rebounds, closely followed by Bill Russell with <strong>21,620</strong>. Chamberlain also holds the record for most rebounds in a single season and the highest rebounds per game average in a single season and for a career. Chamberlain collected the most rebounds in the 1960-61 NBA season where he secured a total of <strong>2,149</strong>, and averaged the most rebounds per game in a season, during that same exact season with <strong>27.2</strong> per game. Chamberlain also holds the all-time record for most rebounds per game in an overall career with <strong>22.8</strong> rebounds average over the course of his career. Chamberlain also holds the records for the most total rebounds in a season with <strong>1,941</strong> by a rookie and the most rebounds averaged by a rookie with <strong>27.0</strong>. Chamberlain also grabbed <strong>45</strong> rebounds in a game during his rookie season, which is the record for most rebounds by a rookie in NBA history. Before that night, Chamberlain had <strong>3</strong> other games where he grabbed <strong>43</strong> rebounds (twice), and <strong>42</strong> rebounds, which now hold the <strong>2nd</strong> and <strong>3rd</strong> spots for most rebounds by a rookie in a single game in league history. Interestingly enough, Chamberlain holds the top <strong>18</strong> spots for most rebounds grabbed in a single game by a rookie. The only other players in the top 25 are Bill Russell, Jerry Lucas, and Maurice Stokes. When Wilt became a passer, he led the league in assists, which makes him the only center in NBA history to lead the league in assists. Wilt also achieved a career high <strong>21</strong> assists in his infamous <strong>20-20-20</strong> game (which still stands as an NBA record for the most assists in a single game from a center). Unfortunately, blocks and steals were not tracked during Wilt's playing days, but there are data sheets that logged <strong>112</strong> games out Chamberlain's career that accounted for his blocks. According to the data sheet, out of the <strong>112</strong> games, Wilt averaged a monstrous <strong>8.8</strong> blocks per game. On a nationally televised game (Christmas Day) he had <strong>23</strong> blocks, while in another game, he had <strong>25</strong> blocks, and in his legendary quintuple-double game, he had <strong>24</strong> blocks, to go with <strong>11</strong> steals. Night in and night out, Chamberlain was a player who could provide everything for his team on the floor and is widely known as one of, if not the best center in NBA history.

                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, Bill Russell had a slow start to his basketball career. In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills and fundamentals of the game as 
                    he had difficulty understanding the game of basketball. This resulted in him being cut from multiple basketball teams at during his time in highschool. It 
                    wouldn't be until Russell caught the attention of a college recruiter by the name of Hal DeJulio that his basketball career would fully take off. Hal was quick to 
                    notice Russell's poor fundamentals and small scoring touch, but he also noticed that Russell had a unforeseen instinct for the game, especially when it came to his 
                    performance in the clutch. This would be a common theme for Russell once he got to the league. Hal would offer Russell a scholarship to the University of San 
                    Francisco, to which Russell excitedly accepted. Russell knew that this was his chance to escape the constant poverty and racism and Russell said himself that he swore 
                    he would make the best of the opportunity. At USF, Russell would become his teams (San Francisco Dons) new starting center, as he stood at 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
                    Russell's extraordinary defensive talent fit well with coach Phil Woolperts focus on defense and calculated half-court play. During his 3 years at USF, Russell 
                    accumulated a number of accolades and achievements. Russell was not only a basketball player at USF, but he was additionally a track and field athlete. It was here 
                    that Russell got to demonstrate his outstanding athleticism, that still seem impossible to achieve today, let alone back in the 50s.

            <h3>Bill Russell's NBA Run</h3>
                <p>
                    If you thought Russell's run in the NBA was smooth, you would be heavily mistaken. Coming into the 1956 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics had the <strong>1st</strong> overall pick, but didn't select Russell. Boston forfeited the first pick to select Forward Tommy Heinsohn, with the territorial pick option. This draft option is no longer present in the NBA Draft, but it existed from 1949 to 1965. The NBA would initiate a special rule, which would give teams exclusive rights to claim local college players. This was done to generate more interest in the professional league, as these picks would give fans the chance to watch popular local college players play for their hometown team. As part of the territorial pick rules, Boston had to forefeit their first round pick. Boston's first round pick would end up in the hands of the Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), but they would decide to pass on drafting Russell. Before the draft, Boston Celtic's coach Red Auerbach persuaded the Celtics owner at the time, Walter Brown, to guarantee Rochester owner, Les Harrison, a multitude of lucrative shows performed by the Ice Capade Dancers (to which Brown was a partial owner of). The Ice Capades were traveling entertainment shows that would feature theatrical ice skating performances. In return for providing these shows to Rochester, Harrison and the Rochester Royals would skip Russell with the first pick. However, there were 3 other main reasons why Rochester decided to pass on Russell and select Si Green with the first pick. The first reason included Russell's delayed arrival and debut until late December, as he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team. The second reason was that the Harlem Globetrotters were predicted to offer Russell a huge contract offer for his services. The third reason was that there was some doubt among a variety of pro coaches that Russell would star in the professional game as he did so in college. Even with Rochester not selecting Russell, Boston wasn't out of the dark yet. The Saint Louis Hawks had the second pick, and they actually did select Russell. However, a few days before the draft, the Celtics and Hawks agreed to a deal that would send All-Star Ed Macauley and draft rights to Cliff Hagan in return for the second overall pick. Russell would technically be picked by the Hawks, but sent to Boston right after. With Russell now secured, the Celtics looked like an entirely different team, as they not only secured 1, but <strong>3</strong> future Hall Of Famers in 1 draft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The season prior to the addition of Russell (1955-56), the Celtics finished with a <strong>39-33</strong> record, which placed them <strong>2nd</strong> in the NBA Eastern Division, behind the Philadelphia Warriors who finished with a strong <strong>45-27</strong> record, which was the best record in the league that season. However, the Celtics didn't make much noise in the playoffs, as they were defeated by the Syracuse Nationals in 3 games. The Celtics also had the <strong>3rd</strong> worst defense in the league finishing, <strong>6th out of 8</strong> in defensive rating. The Philadelphia Warriors would actually go on to win the NBA Championship that season as they were led by a handful of stars including the Hall Of Famers Paul Arizin, Neil Johnston, and Tom Gola. Rounding out that roster included scoring threats like Jack George and Joe Graboski. With this core group of guys, they dismantled the Syracuse Nationals in only 5 games, the same team who had just beaten Boston in the previous round. In those 5 games against Syracuse, <strong>5</strong> players from Philadelphia averaged over double digit points, and <strong>2</strong> averaged over double digit rebounds. Compared to Syracuse who had only <strong>4</strong> players who averaged over double digit points, <strong>1</strong> player who averaged double digit rebounds, and <strong>1</strong> player who averaged over double digit assists. After defeating Syracuse, Philadelphia was set to face off against the Fort Wayne Pistons. Philadelphia would control the pace for the whole series as they beat Fort Wayne in 5 games (<strong>4-1</strong>).

                <h3>Rookie Season (1956-57)</h3>
                <p>
                    With the main addition of Russell, and Tommy Heinsohn, the Celtics finished with a <strong>44-28</strong> record, finishing <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Eastern Division, and having the best record in the league. The Celtics also had the best defense in the league, finishing <strong>1st out of 8</strong>. With other players like Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, and Arnie Risen rounding out the roster, the Celtics had a total of <strong>7</strong> future Hall Of Famers on their roster that season. Tommy Heinsohn would earn the Rookie Of The Year Award that year with averages of <strong>16.2 </strong> points, <strong>9.8</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.6</strong> assists. The Celtics would make their way into the playoffs, and waiting for them was a familiar foe, the Syracuse Nationals. However, the outcome was vastly different than last years result. The Celtics would not only avenge their loss to Syracuse from last year, but they dominated them, sweeping them <strong>3-0</strong>. In those 3 games, Russell averaged a tame <strong>15.3</strong> points and an absurd <strong>28.0</strong> rebounds. Heinsohn led the Celtics in points per game, as he put up <strong>20.3</strong> in those 3 games verse Syracuse. Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman also added in their own contributions as Cousy averaged <strong>19.0</strong> points, <strong>4.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>9.7</strong> assists and Sharman averaged <strong>19.3</strong> points and <strong>3.0</strong> rebounds over the course of the series. The Celtics would find themselves going up against future Hall-Of-Famer Bob Pettit and the St. Louis Hawks. This Hawks squad was very talented with future Hall-Of-Famers Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan, Alex Hannum, Ed Macauley, and Slater Martin all on the roster. This series would go to a hard fought 7th game, where the Celtics would pull away with the victory and the championship trophy. Russell put up <strong>19</strong> points, a monsterous <strong>32</strong> rebounds, and blocked <strong>5</strong> shots in the deciding 7th game, securing his <strong>1st</strong> of many championships to come. Tommy Heinsohn would lead the Celtics in scoring in the 7th game with <strong>37</strong> points, and for good measure, he secured <strong>23</strong> rebounds.

                <h3>Sophomore Season (1957-58)</h3>
                <p> 
                    With Boston securing their first championship ring in franchise history, it was only a matter of time until they became the dynasty we know today. In the next years draft, the Celtics secured another future Hall-Of-Famer, the 6'4 Shooting Guard, Sam Jones. With Sam Jones now secured on the roster, the Celtics would improve their record from the previous season, going from a <strong>44</strong> win team, to a <strong>49</strong> win team. The Celtics finished the regular season with a <strong>49-23</strong> record, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the Eastern Division, and <strong>1st</strong> in the whole league. Russell would have a number of standout performances throughout the regular season, including a game against the Detroit Pistons, where he put up <strong>14</strong> points, <strong>19</strong> rebounds, and an absurd <strong>17</strong> blocks. Less than a week later, Russell would play against the Pistons again, but this time he would put up <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>30</strong> rebounds, and <strong>12</strong> blocks. Then during a matchup with the Philadelphia Warriors, Russell would put up <strong>18</strong> points, <strong>35</strong> rebounds, and <strong>11</strong> blocks. All of these games resulted in wins for Russell and the Celtics. This season was also Russell's first year as an All-Star, which he would be selected to often during the majority of his career. The Celtics would head into the playoffs and their first matchup would be with the Philadelphia Warriors. This series wouldn't be too much to handle for Boston as they beat the Warriors <strong>4-1</strong>. Russell would have standout performances in game 3 and game 5 of the series. In game 3, Russell put up <strong>14</strong> points and an insane <strong>40</strong> rebounds to bring Boston the win at the Boston Garden. In game 5 to close out the series, Russell put up <strong>18</strong> points and <strong>30</strong> rebounds to win the series for the Celtics at the Boston Garden. Heading into the NBA Finals the Celtics were set to play a familiar foe, the Saint Louis Hawks. However, this series would prove to be a lot different then last season's finals. In the first two games, each team split at <strong>1-1</strong>, but in game 3, Russell would go down with a foot injury, which heavily changed the course of the series. Russell would return for game 6, but the Celtics were already down <strong>2-3</strong>. Russell didn't see much playing time, as he only played <strong>20</strong> minutes. The Hawks would come out victorious in the deciding game 6, with their superstar Bob Pettit who dropped <strong>50</strong> points and <strong>19</strong> rebounds to win the game by only <strong>1</strong> point for the Hawks. Still to this very day, this championship is the only championship the hawks had ever won. Russell would be awarded his first ever league MVP during this season as well.

                <h3>Junior Season (1958-59)</h3>
                <p>
                    Luckily for Boston, they would once again gain another fantastic piece to their roster in the off-season. Drafted alongside Bill Russell, and Tom Heinsohn, in '56 the Celtics would also draft future Hall-Of-Famer, K.C Jones. However, Jones wouldn't begin playing for them until 1958 as he would serve two years in the military and would play some exhibition games as a defensive back for the Los Angeles Rams, until he would suffer a leg injury, causing him to quit the sport. He then would head to the Boston training camp to begin his NBA career. With established Boston backcourt guards like Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman already on the roster, K.C wouldn't see much of the floor as he played a reserve roll during his rookie year. He would operate as the backup to Cousy <strong>12 to 13 minutes</strong> per game and averaged <strong>3.5</strong> points. K.C fit perfectly in Boston's system and was able to make the most of the opportunity by winning <strong>8x</strong> championships with the Celtics. K.C's minutes would continue to increase progressively throughout the coming seasons, and when Bob Cousy retired, K.C. would average <strong>30.3</strong> minutes per game in the 1963-64 season. From 1964-65 to 1966-67, K.C. would average <strong>32.2</strong> minutes per game while also averaging <strong>7.7</strong> points, <strong>3.6</strong> rebounds, and <strong>5.6</strong> assists on <strong>39.3%</strong> field goal percentage and <strong>65.5%</strong> free throw percentage. K.C. would remain as the Celtics main point guard for the rest of his career. With the main addition of K.C., the Celtics finished with a <strong>52-20</strong> record, which was the best record in the Eastern Division and the whole league. Boston would head into the playoffs and waiting for them in the Eastern Division finals was the <strong>35-37</strong> Syracuse Nationals, who would take Boston to 7 games before being eliminated by the Celtics. 
                    
                    Boston would then go on to verse the <strong>33-39</strong> Minneapolis Lakers. The Minneapolis Lakers would be led by their star rookie and future Hall-of-Famer, Elgin Baylor, who averaged <strong>24.9</strong> points per game, <strong>15.0</strong> rebounds per game, and <strong>4.1</strong> assists per game in the regular season and <strong>25.5</strong> points per game, <strong>12.0</strong> rebounds per game, and <strong>3.3</strong> assists per game in the playoffs. In the finals, Baylor would average <strong>22.8</strong> points per game, and <strong>11.8</strong> rebounds per game in the series. With other future Hall of Famers Vern Mikkelsen and Slick Leonard on the roster, the Lakers definitely had the talent to put up a fight against Boston, but ultimately couldn't put it all together, which resulted in them getting swept. This would be quite the common theme for the Lakers as they would fall short to the Celtics a total of <strong>6</strong> times in the finals during the 60s. This matchup would also mark the beginning of one of the best rivalries in all of American sports, the Celtics and the Lakers. This championship would also kick start a streak for the Celtics as from 1959 to 1966, they would go on to win a record <strong>8</strong> straight championships, beating the lakers an additional <strong>4</strong> times in that stretch. No team in NBA history has ever won <strong>4</strong> or more rings in a row besides the 60s Celtics. The Celtics also beat the St. Louis Hawks twice and the San Francisco Warriors once during their <strong>8</strong> consecutive championship runs. During the Celtics <strong>8</strong> consecutive title runs, they would continue to add future Hall of Fame talent to the roster.

                <h3>Senior Season</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 1959-60 season, the Celtics didn't make any significant additions to their roster, primarily running with the same roster from the previous, minus a few role players and the addition of another role player, Gene Guarilia. Bill Russell would continue to put up his usual numbers and on the season he averaged <strong>18.2</strong> points and <strong>24.0</strong> rebounds per game. Russell would also have some standout performances in that regular season. On February 13, 1960, Russell recorded <strong>19</strong> points, <strong>33</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>11</strong> blocks to bring the Celtics a <strong>122-120</strong> victory over the Philadelphia Warriors. A little bit over a week later, Russell and the Celtics were versing the Detroit Pistons. In that game, Russell logged <strong>29</strong> points, <strong>28</strong> rebounds, and <strong>12</strong> blocks, to bring the Celtics a <strong>121-107</strong> victory. The Celtics finished that regular season with a <strong>59-16</strong> record, which was the best record in the Eastern Division and in the whole league. In the playoffs, Boston versed the Philadelphia Warriors, whom they defeated <strong>4-2</strong>. In that six game series, Russell put up <strong>20.7</strong> points and <strong>27.0</strong> rebounds per game. Heading into the NBA Finals, they versed the St. Louis Hawks, who took them to 7 games. In game 3, Russell recorded <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>19</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks, which gave the Celtics the victory <strong>102-86</strong> and a <strong>2-1</strong> series lead. In the deciding game 7, Russell put up <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>35</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists, which gave the Celtics the victory <strong>122-103</strong> and securing a third championship ring.

                <h3>1960-61 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Heading into the 1960-61 NBA season, the Celtics drafted the wing Tom "Satch" Sanders in the 1960 NBA Draft. Sanders would be a player who would constantly rotate between the starting lineup and a spot of the bench. Sanders was a well known defender standing at 6'6 at the wing who would be tasked in guarding some of the most talented wings in the league like Elgin Baylor and many others. No matter if it was in the starting lineup or a supporting role off the bench, Sanders always seemed to be one of the difference makers in the outcome of games. Russell would average <strong>16.9</strong> points, <strong>23.9</strong> rebounds, and <strong>3.4</strong> assists, while once again having a multitude of standout performances that season. On January 26, 1961, in a game against the Philadelphia Warriors, Russell recorded <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, <strong>13</strong> blocks, and <strong>15</strong> steals, which gave him an unofficial quadruple-double. The Celtics would win that game <strong>129-121</strong>. On February 5, 1961, in a <strong>123-121</strong> win over the St. Louis Hawks, Russell recorded <strong>23</strong> points, <strong>28</strong> rebounds, <strong>2</strong> assists, and <strong>8</strong> blocks. On March 4, 1961, in a <strong>113-110</strong> win over the New York Knicks, Russell put up <strong>17</strong> points, <strong>26</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>8</strong> blocks. The very next game on March 5, 1961, Russell logged <strong>37</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, <strong>4</strong> assists, and <strong>6</strong> blocks in a <strong>146-129</strong> victory over the Philadelphia Warriors. The Celtics would finish the season with a <strong>57-22</strong> record, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Eastern Division and <strong>1st</strong> in the whole league. The playoffs wouldn't be too chaotic as Boston handled the Syracuse Nationals in 5 games. Notiable performances from Russell came in games 1, 3, and 5. In game 1, Russell logged <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>34</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>8</strong> blocks to give the Celtics a <strong>128-115</strong> victory. In game 3, Russell had <strong>18</strong> points, <strong>39</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>6</strong> blocks to win the game for the Celtics <strong>133-110</strong>. Then in game 5, to close out the series, Russell contributed <strong>25</strong> points, <strong>33</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>15</strong> blocks to give the Celtics a <strong>123-101</strong> victory. The NBA Finals would be much of the same as the Celtics beat the St. Louis Hawks in 5 games. Russell had a standout performance in game 1, as he recorded <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>31</strong> rebounds, <strong>4</strong> assists, and <strong>7</strong> blocks to give the Celtics the victory <strong>129-95</strong>. The Celtics would then add a fourth championship to their evergrowing collection at the end of game 5. Russell would also be awarded with the league MVP that season.

                <h3>1961-62 Season</h3>
                <p> 
                    Heading into the 1961-62 season, the Celtics picked up the 6'5 point guard/shooting guard and future Hall-of-Famer, Carl Braun. By the time the Celtics added Braun to the roster, he was <strong>34</strong> years old and past his prime years, which he spent in New York. He played only <strong>48</strong> games, and played for only an average of <strong>8.6</strong> minutes per game that season. He didn't contribute much to the team, but nonetheless, adding an additional future Hall-of-Famer to the roster definitely is something to shy away from. Russell would continue to have standout performances throughout the regular season, which included games where he recorded <strong>12</strong> blocks, <strong>10</strong> blocks and <strong>5</strong> steals in a single game, and <strong>10</strong> blocks in another game. The game in which Russell recorded <strong>12</strong> blocks came on November 3rd, 1961, where he also contributed with <strong>21</strong> points and <strong>25</strong> rebounds, which gave the Celtics the <strong>112-98</strong> win over Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia Warriors. On January 14th, 1962, Russell would record <strong>23</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>10</strong> blocks, and even <strong>5</strong> steals to lead the Celtics to a <strong>145-136</strong> win over the Philadelphia Warriors. Russell then had a performance less than a week later against the Syracuse Nationals in which he recorded <strong>24</strong> points, <strong>28</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>10</strong> blocks to give the Celtics the <strong>128-103</strong> win. The Celtics would finish with a <strong>60-20</strong> record, much thanks to their league MVP, which was Russell, who put up averages of <strong>18.9</strong> points, <strong>23.6</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4.5</strong> assists in that regular season. The Celtics record this season put them <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Eastern Division and <strong>1st</strong> in the whole league. In the playoffs, the Celtics beat the <strong>49-31</strong> Philadelphia Warriors in 7 games, then defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in 7 games in the NBA Finals. Russell would have impressive performances in games 3, 5, 6, and 7. Game 3 saw Russell put up <strong>26</strong> points, <strong>23</strong> rebounds, and <strong>8</strong> blocks in a Celtics loss <strong>115-117</strong>. Game 5 saw Russell record <strong>26</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>7</strong> blocks in another Celtics loss <strong>121-126</strong>. Game 6 saw near quadruple-double performance by Russell as he logged <strong>19</strong> points, <strong>24</strong> rebounds, <strong>10</strong> assists, and <strong>9</strong> blocks in a Celtics win <strong>119-105</strong>. One of Russell's iconic moments from his career came in the final game of the series. Russell would go on to have a statline of <strong>30</strong> points, <strong>40</strong> rebounds, to go along with <strong>4</strong> assists and <strong>8</strong> blocks. The historic <strong>30</strong> and <strong>40</strong> from Russell gets all the attention and rightfully so when you consider the fact that he played every minute of that game, including overtime. But when the <strong>8</strong> blocks is added in there two, it brings this performance to a whole other level. The Celtics would prevail in overtime, beating the Lakers with a final score of <strong>110-107</strong>, which would give Russell his fifth title.

                <h3>1962-63 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Heading into the 1962-63 season, the Celtics would acquire future Hall of Famer John "Hondo" Havlicek in the 1962 NBA Draft with the 9th pick in the 1st round. Havlicek was a 6'5 small forward/shooting guard who was known to have remarkable athleticism, speed, skill, and intelligence. During his rookie year, Havlicek would come off the bench and put up solid all around numbers of <strong>14.3</strong> points, <strong>6.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.2</strong> assists per game on <strong>44.5%</strong> field goal efficiency and <strong>72.8%</strong> free throw efficiency. Havlicek would continue to develop during the coming seasons and would find himself in the starting lineup in no time. Despite the rich Celtic history, Havlicek would become (and still remains) as the Celtics all time leading scorer in the regular season with <strong>26,395</strong> points. Havlicek would eventually become the key and best player on the Celtics teams in the 70s as he would help them win <strong>2</strong> more championships, tallying to a grand total of <strong>8</strong> championships for Havlicek on his resume. Havlicek would also become the 1973-74 Finals MVP as the Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks in 7 games. An interesting fact to know is that Havlicek has the best NBA Finals record with a perfect <strong>8-0</strong> record, which is tied with Tom Sanders for the greatest record in NBA Finals history. One of Havlicek's best moments would come on April 15th, 1965, where the Celtics were facing elimination by Wilt Chamberlain and the Philadelphia 76ers. Nearing the very end of the 4th quarter, the 76ers were down <strong>107-110</strong>. Wilt would go on to dunk the ball, officially scoring the last <strong>10</strong> points for the 76ers and bringing the lead down to <strong>1</strong> point. Bill Russell would take the ball out of bounds to inbound. However, when Russell went to inbound the ball, it hit a wire, which then deflected the ball out of bounds, giving the possession back to Philadelphia under their own basket. After the Celtics had called a timeout, Hal Greer (another future Hall-of-Famer) would take the ball out of bounds to inbound it. Once the player is given the ball by the referee, they have <strong>5</strong> seconds to inbound the ball. If the inbounder still has the ball when <strong>5</strong> seconds have passed, the ball goes to the opponent. When reflecting on this moment, Havlicek would go on to say that when the official handed the ball to Greer, he bagan counting in his head, from <strong>1000 to 1005</strong>. Havlicek said that once he reached <strong>1004</strong>, he knew that Greer was looking for Chet Walker (another future Hall of Famer), so he turned his head slightly to peak at the direction of the pass and once he saw the ball coming, he intercepted the pass and stole the ball, putting the game away for Boston and helping them to move on to the NBA Finals. Havlicek said that in that moment, the events that played out felt like it was in slow motion for him, which is why he was able to react quickly on the inbound pass to Walker from Greer. Johnny Most (who was a famous American Sports Announcer and was primarily known for his gravelly radio voice for the Boston Celtics from 1953 to 1990) was the radio announcer during this game and when Havlicek stole the ball, he shouted in excitement, which has become one of the most popular sports announcer moments in history. On April 9th, 1978, Havlicek would play the last game of his career and announce his retirement from the league. The Celtics would also acquire the 6'9 center, Clyde Lovellette, who would also be a future Hall of Famer. Like Braun, the Celtics acquired Lovellette during the twilight years of his career. Lovellette would spend the prime of his career playing for the Lakers, Cincinnati Royals, and St. Louis Hawks. During his prime years, he was a <strong>20</strong> point per game scorer, while also averaging <strong>11.3</strong> rebounds per game, to go along with <strong>1.9</strong> assists per game. During his time in Boston, he would only average <strong>6.6</strong> points per game, <strong>2.9</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.5</strong> assists per game, while also playing an average of <strong>9.5</strong> minutes per game. He manly served as a backup center off the bench for Boston during his two seasons there. The Celtics would finish the regular season with a <strong>58-22</strong> record, which once again placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the Eastern Division, and in the whole league. Russell would be awarded with the league MVP once more this season, bringing his tally to a total of <strong>4</strong> league MVPs and would mark his <strong>3rd</strong> consecutive MVP. During the regular season, Russell recorded some impressive statlines. On January 20th, 1963, Russell put up a statline of <strong>29</strong> points, <strong>43</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, <strong>12</strong> blocks, and <strong>5</strong> steals to give the Celtics a <strong>133-121</strong> victory. On February 22nd, 1963, Russell put up <strong>19</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and <strong>10</strong> blocks, but the Celtics would lose this game to the Lakers with a final score of <strong>105-113</strong>. Two days later and Russell would avenge his loss by putting up <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>17</strong> rebounds, and <strong>12</strong> blocks in a <strong>119-109</strong> victory over the Lakers. Then a month later, Russell would log <strong>19</strong> points, <strong>36</strong> rebounds, <strong>8</strong> assists, and <strong>11</strong> blocks, which was a near quadruple-double statline which brought the Celtics the win <strong>125-116</strong> against the Syracuse Nationals.

                    In the playoffs that year, the Celtics defeated the Cincinnati Royals in 7 games. In game 4, Russell put up <strong>26</strong> points, <strong>21</strong> rebounds, <strong>7</strong> assists, and <strong>9</strong> blocks in a <strong>128-110</strong> Celtic win. In game 5, Russell recorded a statline of <strong>24</strong> points, <strong>26</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>9</strong> blocks in a <strong>125-120</strong> win for the Celtics. After defeating the Oscar Robertson led Cincinnati Royals, it was a Celtic and Laker rematch in the NBA Finals. The Celtics would defeat the Lakers in six games with Russell having quite a game in the closing game of the series. In that sixth game to close out the series, Russell put up <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>24</strong> rebounds, <strong>9</strong> assists, and <strong>8</strong> blocks to give the Celtics the victory <strong>112-109</strong>, which earned Russell his sixth NBA championship

                <h3>1963-64</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 1963-64 season, the Celtics acquired the 6'6 small forward/power forward Willie Naulls from the San Francisco Warriors and the 6'3 point guard/shooting guard Larry Siegfried from the Cincinnati Royals. Willie was past his prime years with New York, but still chipped in <strong>10.3</strong> points and <strong>4.6</strong> rebounds per game, while playing an average of nearly <strong>20</strong> minutes per game (<strong>19.6</strong> minutes per game respectively) during the <strong>3</strong> seasons he spent in Boston. Luckily for Boston, Siegfried was a rookie when he was added to the roster and would develop into a solid guard for them. He only chipped in <strong>3.3</strong> points, <strong>1.6</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.3</strong> assists per game during that season as he played only <strong>8.4</strong> minutes per game and played in only <strong>31</strong> games. Siegfried would develop into a <strong>13.4</strong> points per game scorer, to go along with <strong>3.1</strong> rebounds and <strong>3.8</strong> assists per game during his prime years in Boston, while also playing <strong>27.9</strong> minutes per game. Russell and the Celtics finished the regular season with a <strong>59-21</strong> record, which was good enough for the <strong>1st</strong> spot in the NBA Eastern Division and the whole league. Russell's MVP streak would be broken as the future Hall-of-Fame guard Osacr Robertson won the league MVP this season as he put up <strong>31.4</strong> points, <strong>9.9</strong> rebounds, and <strong>11.0</strong> assists. His <strong>11.0</strong> assist per game average was the highest in the league. Oscar led the league in assists this season and in triple-doubles with <strong>26</strong>. The Royals weren't a bad team by any means this season as their roster consisted of <strong>4</strong> future Hall-of-Famers which included Oscar Robertson, Jack Twyman, Wayne Embry, and Jerry Lucas. The Royals would finish that season with a <strong>55-25</strong> record, which placed them <strong>2nd</strong> in the Eastern Division and <strong>2nd</strong> overall in the league. In the regular season, Russell would continue to rack up blocks as he would have at least <strong>2</strong> games where he had double-digit blocks with <strong>12</strong>, and <strong>10</strong>, while putting up seasonal averages of <strong>15.0</strong> points, <strong>24.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4.7</strong> assists. The recorded <strong>10</strong> blocks he had in a game this season came against the Philadelphia 76ers as he recorded <strong>24</strong> points, <strong>23</strong> rebounds, <strong>10</strong> assists, and <strong>10</strong> blocks, which gave him the unofficial quadruple-double and the win for the Celtics as they beat the 76ers <strong>120-109</strong>. Russell would go on to lead the league in total rebounds with <strong>1,930</strong> and rebounds per game with <strong>24.7</strong>. Heading into the playoffs, Russell would get his revenge on the Cincinnati guard who broke his MVP streak as the Celtics handled the Cincinnati Royals in 5 games. Russell would record <strong>11</strong> blocks in game 1 of the series to give the Celtics a <strong>103-87</strong> victory. In game 4, Russell blocked a total of <strong>6</strong> shots in a Celtic loss <strong>93-102</strong>. Then in game 5, Russell once again had <strong>6</strong> blocks, but this time he also recorded <strong>3</strong> steals, which was enough to give the Celtics the win <strong>109-95</strong>.

                    After the defeat of the Royals, the Celtics went on to verse the San Francisco Warriors, who had the dominant twin towers in Nate Thurmond and Wilt Chamberlain. It would seem as if the Celtics didn't have enough height to deal with the twin towers on the Warriors roster, but that would not be the case as Boston defeated San Francisco in only five games. In game 1, Russell had <strong>12</strong> blocks, to go along with <strong>9</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists, which was enough to give the Celtics the win <strong>108-96</strong>. Then in game 5 to close out the series, Russell blocked a total of <strong>13</strong> shots, to go along with <strong>14</strong> points, <strong>26</strong> rebounds, and <strong>6</strong> assists, which brought the Celtics the win <strong>105-99</strong> and Russell would secure his seventh NBA championship.

                <h3>1964-65 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Heading into the 1964-65 season, the Celtics were pretty tame with additions to their roster. In the 1964 NBA Draft, the Celtics selected the 7'0 center/power forward Mel Counts with the 9th pick in the 1st round, who was another solid role player off the bench, putting up <strong>6.8</strong> points and <strong>5.8</strong> rebounds per game, along with <strong>0.6</strong> assists per game in the <strong>121</strong> games he played for Boston, while playing only <strong>13.2</strong> minutes per game. Mel wasn't known for his time in Boston, but by him being on the right team at the right time, being in Boston made him a <strong>2x</strong> NBA Champion. The Celtics also selected Ron Bonham in the 1964 NBA Draft with the 9th pick in the 2nd round. In a total of 76 games played for Boston, Ron put up <strong>6.3</strong> points, <strong>1.5</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.4</strong> assists per game as another role player off the bench as he only averaged <strong>9.0</strong> minutes per game during his time in Boston. The Celtics then also took the 6'10 center/power forward and future Hall of Famer, John Thompson with the 9th pick, in the 3rd round of the 1964 NBA Draft. Although he is a Hall of Famer, he only played <strong>74</strong> games in his NBA Career with Boston, averaging <strong>3.5</strong> points, <strong>3.5</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.3</strong> assists per game, in only <strong>10.4</strong> minutes played per game. Like Mel, John was another case of being on the right team at the right time, so even though he spent two seasons in Boston and for his whole NBA Career, it made him a <strong>2x</strong> Champion. Boston also acquired the 6'4 shooting guard Gerry Ward through a trade and averaged <strong>1.7</strong> points, <strong>1.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.0</strong> assists in only <strong>10.0</strong> minutes played per game. He also played only <strong>3</strong> games for Boston. The Celtics also had the 6'10 center/power forward Bevo Nordmann on the roster at the start of the season. But much like Ward, Nordmann only played <strong>3</strong> games for Boston as he put up <strong>2.0</strong> points, <strong>2.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.0</strong> assist per game in only <strong>8.3</strong> minutes played per game. During the regular season, Russell would have games where he put up <strong>12</strong> blocks on <strong>2</strong> seperate occasions, and a game where he logged <strong>9</strong> blocks and <strong>4</strong> steals. In one of the games where Russell recorded <strong>12</strong> blocks, it came as a part of a unofficial quadruple-double. That game came on November 8th, 1964, when Russell's Celtics defeated the Cincinnati Royals <strong>106-103</strong> as Russell logged <strong>11</strong> points, <strong>23</strong> rebounds, <strong>11</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks, which gave Russell the unofficial quadruple-double. In the game Russell recorded <strong>9</strong> blocks and <strong>4</strong> steals in, he also contributed <strong>20</strong> points, <strong>41</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists, as the Celtics beat the San Francisco Warriors <strong>106-98</strong>. The Celtics would finish the regular season with a <strong>62-18</strong> record, which placed them <strong>1st</strong> in the NBA Eastern Division, and <strong>1st</strong> in the whole league. Russell would take back his MVP award this season, which would be the last MVP of his career, with averages of <strong>14.1</strong> points, <strong>24.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>5.3</strong> assists. Russell's <strong>24.1</strong> rebound average was the best that season and he secured another rebounding title as his regular season total of <strong>1878</strong> was the most rebounds that season.

                    Heading into the playoffs, Boston was set to verse the Philadelphia 76ers. This series would go to 7 games, and in games 2, 5, and 7, Russell recorded <strong>4</strong> blocks, <strong>12</strong> blocks and <strong>3</strong> steals, and <strong>6</strong> blocks in the deciding seventh game. The Celtics would prevail in the seventh game with a final score of <strong>110-109</strong>. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics versed the Los Angeles Lakers, and in game 5, Russell would close out the series with a statline of <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>30</strong> rebounds, <strong>4</strong> assists, and <strong>3</strong> blocks to lead to a final score of <strong>129-96</strong>. This championship would mark as Russell's eighth championship.

                <h3>1965-66 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Heading into the 1965-66 season, the Celtics would make some more exciting additions to their roster. The Celtics would acquire the 6'6 small forward/power forward and future Hall of Famer Don Nelson, after he had been waived out of the league. Nelson would spend the rest of his career with the Celtics, which made him a <strong>5x</strong> Champion. During his time in Boston, Nelson would average <strong>11.4</strong> points, <strong>5.2</strong> rebounds, <strong>1.6</strong> assists, <strong>0.3</strong> steals, and <strong>0.1</strong> blocks, while only playing an average of <strong>21.8</strong> minutes per game, for a total of <strong>872</strong> games played for Boston. The numbers Nelson put up were quite tame, but what made him great can't be determined by looking at a box score. Nelson was known for what has been named “the miracle shot”, which came during the 1969 NBA Finals between Boston and the Lakers (his former team). With just over a minute to spare in the game with the Celtics holding on to a <strong>103-102</strong> lead, Nelson shot a jumper from the foul-line that would hit the back of the rim, then bounced straight up several feet, before eventually dropping through the basket, which helped secure Boston's <strong>11th</strong> title in <strong>13</strong> seasons, and Nelson's <strong>3rd</strong> title with Boston. During his playing days, Nelson was also known to be an excellent defender and was known to be as tough as they come. Along with Nelson, the Celtics acquired additional role players Si Green, Ron Watts, and Woody Sauldsberry. The 6'2 point guard/shooting guard Si Green put up <strong>3.2</strong> points, <strong>1.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.9</strong> assists per game in only a total of <strong>10</strong> games played for Boston on only <strong>9.2</strong> minutes per game. The 6'6 forward Ron Watts would be acquired through the 1965 NBA Draft as Boston selected him with the 9th pick in the 2nd round. Watts would play for Boston for two seasons and average <strong>1.4</strong> points, <strong>1.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.1</strong> assists in <strong>28</strong> total games played for Boston and averaged <strong>3.3</strong> minutes per game. The 6'7 center/power forward Woody Sauldsberry would also be joining Boston this season. By this time, Woody was past his prime seasons and was now finding himself in a bench role on the Celtics roster as he averaged <strong>4.4</strong> points, <strong>3.6</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.4</strong> assists in only <strong>39</strong> total games played for Boston while only playing <strong>13.6</strong> minutes per game. Out of the performances Russell had during this season, there was one game that stands above the rest. On February 7th, 1966, in a <strong>112-107</strong> victory over the San Francisco Warriors, Bill Russell put up <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>11</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and a mind blowing <strong>25</strong> blocks. The Celtics would finish the regular season with a <strong>54-26</strong> record, which placed them <strong>2nd</strong> in the Eastern Division, and <strong>2nd</strong> overall in the league. Due to the Celtics not having the best record in the East and in the whole league, they had to play in an extra playoff series. The Celtics would defeat the Cincinnati Royals in 5 games in the Eastern Division Semifinals, defeat the 76ers in 5 games in the Eastern Division Finals, and defeat the Lakers in 7 games in the NBA Finals. In game 2 against the Royals, Russell recorded <strong>4</strong> blocks, to go along with <strong>25</strong> points and <strong>16</strong> rebounds to bring the Celtics the win <strong>132-125</strong>. In game 2 against the Lakers in the NBA Finals, Russell recorded <strong>6</strong> blocks and <strong>3</strong> steals, to go along with <strong>19</strong> points, <strong>24</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists to help the Celtics win the game <strong>129-109</strong>. Then in game 7, to close out the series, Russell recorded <strong>11</strong> blocks, to go with <strong>25</strong> points, and <strong>32</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists to win the game and series for the Celtics with a final score of <strong>95-93</strong>. This would secure a ninth championship for Russell.

                <h3>1966-67 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    The Celtics streak of championships would then be snapped in the 1966-67 season as they were eliminated by Wilt Chamberlain's 76ers in the Eastern Division Finals in only 5 games, who went on to win the NBA Championship. This season would be a massive adjustment period for Boston as their main coach, Red Auerbach, was moved to the position of the team executive. Filling that coach role would be Bill Russell, who made history becoming the first black player/coach in sports history. With Russell in his new role, Boston would have to adjust to such a change. The Celtics still finished with a <strong>60-21</strong> record, which placed them <strong>2nd</strong> in the Eastern Division and <strong>2nd</strong> in the whole league. Prior to the season's beginning, the Celtics would once again acquire more talent to their roster. The Celtics would take the 6'4 shooting guard/point guard Jim Barnett, with the 8th pick in the 1st round of the 1966 NBA Draft. Jim would be yet another role player who averaged <strong>4.1</strong> points, <strong>1.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.9</strong> assists in only <strong>48</strong> total games played for Boston on only <strong>8.0</strong> minutes per game. The Celtics would also add the future Hall of Famer Wayne Embry, standing at only 6'8 at the center position. At this point in his career, Wayne was way past his prime with the Cincinnati Royals. Wayne would serve as a backup center for Russell and would mainly come off the bench. During the two seasons he spent in Boston, he played in a total of <strong>150</strong> games, while averaging <strong>5.8</strong> points, <strong>4.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.6</strong> assists, on only <strong>12.1</strong> minutes per game. The Celtics would then add another future Hall of Famer to the roster, the 6'7 power forward/small forward Bailey Howell. Howell was already at the age of <strong>30</strong> by this point, but that didn't alter his performance for the Celtics. During his time in Boston, Bailey put up <strong>18.0</strong> points, <strong>8.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.5</strong> assists in <strong>30.7</strong> minutes per game, as he played at the starting power forward position. Bailey had quite the shoes to fill as he was replacing Celtic great Tom Heinsohn. But Bailey rose to that challenge and was a perfect fit with the Celtics in his starting role. Bailey was a player who could do a little bit of everything. He was a solid scorer, solid rebounder, and a great defender. Lastly, the Celtics acquired the 6'6 power forward Toby Kimball. Toby had actually been drafted by Boston with the 9th pick, in the 3rd round, of the 1965 NBA Draft, but decided to play in Italy. His actual debut season would be this season and as a rookie he put up tame numbers of <strong>2.6</strong> points, <strong>3.8</strong> rebounds, <strong>0.3</strong> assists in only <strong>5.8</strong> minutes per game as he played for a total of <strong>38</strong> games for the Celtics. Russell would also have a tame year, as to be expected with him both coaching and playing for the team.

                <h3>1967-68 Season</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the 1967-68 season rolled around, the Celtics would have another tame year with the acquisitions to their roster. The Celtics picked up the 6'1 point guard, Mal Graham, with the 11th pick in the 1st round of the 1967 NBA Draft. Graham would be a role player, as he averaged only <strong>12.7</strong> minutes per game, playing in a total of <strong>70</strong> games for Boston (and his whole NBA career), while putting up <strong>4.7</strong> points, <strong>1.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.1</strong> assists during his two seasons in Boston. Boston would also acquire the 6'7 small forward, Johnny Jones, another role player. Johnny averaged <strong>4.2</strong> points, <strong>2.2</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.5</strong> assists, in only <strong>51</strong> total games played for Boston in only <strong>9.3</strong> minutes per game. The Celtics would then acquire two more 6'2 guards, Tom Thacker and Rick Weitzman. Thacker played both guard positions, while Weitzman only played the shooting guard position. Weitzman played in only <strong>25</strong> games for the Celtics (and his whole career) averaging <strong>1.3</strong> points, <strong>0.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.3</strong> assists in only <strong>3.0</strong> minutes played per game. Thacker would also serve the role of coming off the bench, and played only <strong>65</strong> games for Boston. He would average <strong>4.2</strong> points, <strong>2.5</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.1</strong> assists in only <strong>12.0</strong> minutes played per game. Russell would continue to put up solid all around numbers of <strong>12.5</strong> points, <strong>18.6</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4.6</strong> assists per game. The Celtics would finish the regular season <strong>54-28</strong>, good enough to land them the <strong>2nd</strong> spot in the Eastern Division and <strong>3rd</strong> overall in the league. Russell would have quite the game for himself on December 15th, 1967 versus the San Diego Rockets. In that game, Russell recorded <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>27</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and a mind blowing <strong>20</strong> blocks, which gave the Celtics the <strong>114-101</strong> victory. Heading into the playoffs, the Celtics were determined to avenge their loss in the Eastern Division Finals from last season. Even with the Celtics having to play an additional round in the playoffs, the Celtics were able to make it all the way to the NBA Finals. On their way there, the Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons in <strong>6</strong> games, with Russell having <strong>7</strong> blocks, with <strong>15</strong> points, <strong>34</strong> rebounds, and <strong>9</strong> assists in game 1, which was enough to win the game for the Celtics <strong>123-116</strong>. Waiting for Boston in the Eastern Division Finals was the <strong>62-20</strong> Philadelphia 76ers. Philadelphia would take Boston to <strong>7</strong> games, but the Celtics would prevail in the end, beating the 76ers in the 7th game to advance to the NBA Finals. In the 7th game versus Philadelphia, Russell recorded <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>26</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>10</strong> blocks, to close out the series with a final score of <strong>100-96</strong>. The Celtics would then face the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals and defeat them in <strong>6</strong> games. In those <strong>6</strong> games versus the Lakers, Russell's blocks were tracked, which ended up coming out to an average of an absurd <strong>9.5</strong> blocks per game. In game <strong>4</strong>, Russell blocked <strong>15</strong> shots, while also putting up <strong>11</strong> points, <strong>22</strong> rebounds, and <strong>6</strong> assists, but unfortunately for Boston, they would lose that game <strong>105-118</strong>. In game <strong>6</strong>, in order to close out the series, Russell would log <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>19</strong> rebounds, <strong>6</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks, which brought the Celtics the win and the championship with a final score of <strong>124-109</strong>. This championship would bring Russell's total to an enormous <strong>10</strong> rings.

                <h3>1968-69 Season (Conclusion Season)</h3>
                <p>
                    Heading into the final season of the Celtics dynasty of the 60s (1968-69 season), the Celtics would once again make additions to their roster. Boston would draft the 6'5 shooting guard Don Chaney, with the 12th pick in the 1st round of the 1968 NBA Draft. Chaney would become a valuable member of the Celtics teams in the 70s, but during his rookie and sophomore seasons, he came off the bench. During his first two seasons in Boston, Chaney put up <strong>4.7</strong> points, <strong>2.4</strong> rebounds, and <strong>1.1</strong> assists in only <strong>12.6</strong> minutes played per game. Chaney was known to be an excellent defender who could guard his man fairly well. In the same 1968 NBA Draft, the Celtics would also select the 6'7 center/power forward, Rich Johnson, with the 10th pick in the 4th round. Johnson would spend three years with the Celtics and serve as a backup center, as he would average <strong>4.7</strong> points, <strong>2.7</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.4</strong> assists in a total of <strong>97</strong> games played for Boston in only <strong>11.1</strong> minutes per game. The Celtics would also add the 6'8 power forward Bud Olsen through trades, but would then trade Olsen only <strong>7</strong> games into the regular season. In those <strong>7</strong> games, Olsen would come off the bench and put up averages of <strong>2.0</strong> points, <strong>2.0</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.6</strong> assists in only <strong>6.1</strong> minutes played per game. The Celtics would then acquire the 6'1 point guard Em Bryant from New York. Bryant was a player who got a ton of minutes, even though he came off the bench as he averaged <strong>6.7</strong> points, <strong>3.1</strong> rebounds, and <strong>2.7</strong> assists in <strong>151</strong> total games played for Boston (<strong>2</strong> seasons) in <strong>19.9</strong> minutes played per game. Lastly, the Celtics would add the 6'8 power forward/center Jim Barnes, after receiving him in a trade from Chicago. Barnes would go on to play <strong>2</strong> seasons with Boston as he averaged <strong>5.6</strong> points, <strong>4.3</strong> rebounds, and <strong>0.6</strong> assists in <strong>126</strong> total games played for Boston in only <strong>13.0</strong> minutes played per game, coming off the bench. With Russell announcing that this season would be his last, going out on top as a champion was destined to occur. The Celtics finished the regular season with a bumpy, but still solid, <strong>48-34</strong> record, which placed them 4th in the Eastern Division, and tied for the 4th spot in the whole league. Russell would also have some standout performances during his last season. The biggest performance Russell displayed in his farewell season came against the Los Angeles Lakers on January 10, 1969. In that game, Russell recorded <strong>8</strong> points, <strong>17</strong> rebounds, <strong>8</strong> assists, and <strong>21</strong> blocks, which gave Boston the win with a final score of <strong>88-82</strong>. Despite the doubts that this team would win the title, the Celtics made the NBA Finals. On their way there, the Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in <strong>5</strong> games, with Russell having quite a performance in game 1, as he put up <strong>2</strong> points, <strong>15</strong> rebounds, <strong>8</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks, which gave the Celtics the win with a final score of <strong>114-100</strong>. The Celtics then defeated the New York Knicks in the next round in <strong>6</strong> games. To close out the series in the sixth game against the Knicks, Russell recorded <strong>12</strong> points, <strong>21</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>6</strong> blocks, which gave the Celtics the win with a final score of <strong>106-105</strong>. Then in the NBA Finals, the Celtics would be taken to <strong>7</strong> games, with the Celtics closing out the series and Russell's career in the 7th game, giving Russell his final championship ring, which tallied up to <strong>11</strong> in total from him in his career. The Celtics would lose the first game in the series, despite Russell putting up <strong>16</strong> points, <strong>27</strong> rebounds, <strong>5</strong> assists, and <strong>4</strong> blocks, with a final score of <strong>118-120</strong>. However, the Celtics would go on to win games <strong>3, 4, 6</strong>, and the decisive game <strong>7</strong>.

                <h3>Russell's Insane Athleticism</h3>
                <p>
                    To further emphasize Russell's supurb athletic abilites, it is key to look at his frame. Russell was <strong>6'10</strong> and weighed around <strong>230</strong> pounds in his prime physical form. At USF in his graduation year (1956), he competed in the high jump at the West Coast Relays. Russell would achieve a high jump measured at <strong>6 feet 9 and 1/4 inches (or 2.06m)</strong>, which placed him as the <strong>2nd</strong> highest jumper in the United States and <strong>7th</strong> in the whole world. Russell also remarked saying that in his playing days, he could get his eyes above the rim and touch the top of the backboard with ease. Not only could Russell jump through the roof, he also quite a pair of wheels on him too. Russell would also compete in the <strong>440 yard race (or 402.3m)</strong> where he finished with a time of <strong>49.6 seconds</strong>. To go along with his extraordinary speed and leaping ability, he also had a <strong>7'4</strong> wingspan.

                <h3>Russell's Career Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    It goes without saying that the Boston Celtics ruled the Basketball world in the 60s. Bill Russell had one of the greatest careers most Basketball players could ever dream of having. Not only was he a phenomenal player, he was also a wonderful leader. He helped build the Boston Celtics into a dynasty that has forever been inscribed in the history books of the NBA. Without the leadership, skill, heart, intelligence, and hustle from Russell, the Celtics would be nowhere near the mountain top of the NBA's rich history. Russell took every opportunity to learn the game and build upon his intelligence for it. Whenever players like Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, etc wanted to learn and understand more about the game, they had guys like Bill Russell to go to. Whenever Bill Russell wanted to learn something, Bill Russell had only himself. Bill Russell will always be known as the man who changed how the game is played, a man who dominated a tough era of basketball, and a man who could lead his team to wins and who has the title of the greatest winner of American sports. To put Russell's winning into perspective, consider this. Russell won 11 championships in 13 seasons, that means he won the championship <strong>84.6%</strong> of the time in his career. If that is not enough to impress you, then consider this. Russell played in a total of <strong>10 game 7's</strong> in the NBA playoffs (<strong>5 of those game 7's</strong> took place in the NBA Finals) and out of those <strong>10</strong> games, Bill Russell never lost once. He has a spotless <strong>10-0</strong> record in game 7's. To add on to his amazing feat of winning, Russell achieved all this before his late 30s. Throughout both the playoffs and regular season, Russell played in a total of <strong>21</strong> win or take all, somebody is going home tonight games, his record in those games was <strong>21-0</strong>. Russell would retire after game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, which placed him at <strong>35</strong> years old. Russell could have possibly won a few more championships, bringing his total of championship rings to even more of an impossible amount to surpass. Considering all of Russell's accolades and accomplishments, it's no wonder why some people consider him to be the Greatest Player of All-Time.

                    For his NBA Career, Russell was an <strong>12x</strong> All-Star, <strong>4x</strong> Rebounding Leader, <strong>11x</strong> All-NBA, <strong>5x</strong> League MVP, <strong>1962-63</strong> All-Star Game MVP, <strong>1968-69</strong> All-Defensive Team, and an <strong>11x</strong> NBA Champion.

                <h3>Bill Russell's Impact on the league</h3>
                <p>
                    It is widely known that Bill Russell impacted the league when he played. The league had never seen a player like Russell before, so they had no idea how he would impact the league. One of the most notable impacts from Russell was his defensive style of play. Even back in college, Russell played the game vertically, when it had always been played horizontally. Russell would jump straight up to block a shot, which was never seen before. In an interview, Russell stated how during a college game, he was matched up against an All-American center. He said that the first <strong>5-6</strong> times the All-American would try to score, Russell blocked each one of his attempts. He then goes on to say that his coach told him that he can't play defense like that because he had never seen someone who played the game vertically to block shots. The same thing would happen once Russell got into the league. Russell recalled a time when his coach, Red Auerbach, pulled Russell aside and told him that he had no idea what Russell was doing so he couldn't help him, but that he would make Russell's unique style of play work within the Celtics system. Russell was also considered the first center to be able to bring the ball up the court with immense speed and finish the play at the other end (coast to coast). Russell wasn't known to lead his teams to wins, on the offensive side of the ball. Russell's impact on the defensive side of the ball is what led his teams to victory. Russell also impacted the league in the way he dominated the games biggest stage, the NBA Finals. Russell is remembered for his <strong>11</strong> championship rings and clutch performances in the NBA Finals, especially in game 7 of the 1962 NBA finals. That game would go into overtime where the Celtics would ultimately prevail and win the title as Russell put up <strong>30</strong> points and <strong>40</strong> rebounds and played every minute of the game. For his impact and reputation in the NBA Finals, the NBA's Finals MVP is now called the Bill Russell Finals MVP. Russell's overall record in the NBA Finals is <strong>11-1</strong>. Included in that stretch saw Russell and the Celtics winning <strong>8</strong> straight championships at one point. In Russell's last <strong>3</strong> seasons in the league, Russell would actually serve as his team's head coach, while also playing for the team, which made him the first black player-coach in American sports history. In those <strong>3</strong> seasons, he would lead the Celtics to <strong>2</strong> more championships. With Russell's all-time defensive talent, leadership, unique skill set, and clutch gene, he impacted how the league views the center position. He would have a <strong>13</strong> year career, playing for only the Boston Celtics.

                <h3>Description of Era</h3>
                <p>
                    It goes without saying that the NBA in the 1960s was vastly different from the NBA in the modern day. However, most don't know how impactful the 60s era of Basketball really was. Usually when people bring up the 60s, they usually mention Russell's Championships, Wilt Chamberlain's mind blowing stats, Oscar Robertson's Triple Double average, and Jerry West's <strong>0-8</strong> record in the NBA Finals. However, the league was much more than that. This era was defined by its superstar centers who basically ran the league at the time. The game was extremely fast paced as it was common for many teams, like the Celtics, to run the fastbreak (which was a style of play that the Celtics built). The fastbreak is a style of play where players and teams try to score before the defense can get set. This is commonly initiated off grabbing a rebound and outlet passing to teammates who are already traveling up the court to the opponents basket. It was also important to note that the jump shot was still in its early development so a lot of players were still shooting a majority of layups or dunks to score. For players who preferred to score off jumpers, they typically had unorthodox shooting forms, which usually equated to a ton of missed shots. Players like Jerry West and Oscar Robertson who scored a majority of their points off of jumpers were considered to be ahead of their time, as both players were known to have a smooth jump shot shooting form that was very effective. Even a few centers in the league like Wilt Chamberlain and Walt Bellamy were known to have a smooth jumper that was lethal and very effective. Wilt was one of, if not the first player to really master the art of the fadeaway, as it was common for him to back down his opponents with his astronomical strength, turn around and shoot the basketball as he was fading away from the basket, which would often bank off the glass and go through the basket. Wilt had said in many interviews that he didn't want to just use his strength to essentially assert his will and score through dunks and layups, but rather he wanted to play with more finesse to show that he was also skilled and not just some brute force who used his strength to score. It is also commonly known that the 60s era of Basketball was the most inflated statistical era of Basketball history. One of the major statistical categories that was heavily inflated during that time was the rebounding numbers. Due to the faster style of play, more shot attempts were taken, which equated to more misses (considering the league average was in the <strong>40%</strong> range), meaning the centers had more rebounds available to grab. It would be a common thing in the 60s for a center to tally up <strong>15-20</strong> or more rebounds night in and night out. Centers who were especially dominant in these areas included guys like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Nate Thurmond, and Walt Bellamy. These guys were also considered to be superb athletes in their own right. The era of the 60s was also known to be quite physical. Many players who played in that era have stated how physical the defenses were in that time. Defense was extremely physical, both on the interior and perimeter. Wilt Chamberlain was a prime example of this. When teams were matched up against him, it was common for Wilt to be guarded with an elbow in his back, punched, shoved, scratched, etc as team's tried to knock him off his game. Guys like Bill Russell were also extremely physical defensively. Russell specialized in defense, shot blocking, and rebounding, and was known to be an all time great at that end of the floor. Every shot that was taken anywhere near Russell, you could bet a good chunk of change that he was contesting that shot, which due to his outstanding leaping ability and long arms, resulted in many of those shots getting blocked. It was also common for players to get slammed to the floor when they drove into the middle to attack the basket. The 3 second violation had already been put into the league by this point, but centers could still basically stand in the paint, or just near the rim in general, all day during this era. Meaning that pretty much every shot a player took on a drive at the basket or anywhere near the center, was met with extreme physical defense. It is also important to mention that until the 2000s, defense was played either with man on man, double team, or through <strong>1 on 1</strong> isolation situations. Players would play tight defense, leaving little to no room for the offensive player to get into an ideal position to score. This applied to those in the 60s as well. If you want to look at the offensive side of the ball in the 60s, they played a team style game. It is also important to note that the team scoring average was above <strong>110</strong> in the 60s, despite the low league average percentage, and the extremely physical defense that was played. Teams like the Celtics were known for their unselfishness and getting the entire team involved on every possession. The team style of basketball was very common in the 60s as a majority of the teams understood the importance of getting everyone involved. A majority of the players who played in that era didn't try to do anything fancy and stuck to using the fundamentals of the game as their primary skill set as making highlight plays wasn't something on their minds. Speaking of which, the way the players approached the game in the 60s was also vastly different than how players do today. It was more common to see more and more players play <strong>60, 70, and 80</strong> games in a season. Very rarely would you see a player taking a visible night off during the games in that decade. The players approached the game like a real life job. They took the game seriously, didn't take any unnecessary breaks, put in the work both on and off the court, and didn't take the game for granted. All of these things are what make the 60s era one of the best eras in all of Basketball history.
