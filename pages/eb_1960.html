            <h3>How it all started</h3>
            <p>
                Believe it or not, Bill Russell had a slow start to his basketball career. In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills and fundamentals of the game as 
                he had difficulty understanding the game of basketball. This resulted in him being cut from multiple basketball teams at during his time in highschool. It 
                wouldn't be until Russell caught the attention of a college recruiter by the name of Hal DeJulio that his basketball career would fully take off. Hal was quick to 
                notice Russell's poor fundamentals and small scoring touch, but he also noticed that Russell had a unforeseen instinct for the game, especially when it came to his 
                performance in the clutch. This would be a common theme for Russell once he got to the league. Hal would offer Russell a scholarship to the University of San 
                Francisco, to which Russell excitedly accepted. Russell knew that this was his chance to escape the constant poverty and racism and Russell said himself that he swore 
                he would make the best of the opportunity. At USF, Russell would become his teams (San Francisco Dons) new starting center, as he stood at 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
                Russell's extraordinary defensive talent fit well with coach Phil Woolperts focus on defense and calculated half-court play. During his 3 years at USF, Russell 
                accumulated a number of accolades and achievements. Russell was not only a basketball player at USF, but he was additionally a track and field athlete. It was here 
                that Russell got to demonstrate his outstanding athleticism, that still seem impossible to achieve today, let alone back in the 50s.
            </p>
            <h3>Russell's Insane Athleticism</h3>
            <p>
                To further emphasize Russell's supurb athletic abilites, it is key to look at his frame. Russell was <strong>6'10</strong> and weighed around <strong>230</strong> pounds in his prime physical form. At 
                USF in his graduation year (1956), he competed in the high jump at the West Coast Relays. Russell would achieve a high jump measured at <strong>6 feet 9 and 1/4 inches (or 
                2.06m)</strong>, which placed him as the <strong>2nd</strong> highest jumper in the United States and <strong>7th</strong> in the whole world. Russell also remarked saying that in his playing days, he could 
                get his eyes above the rim and touch the top of the backboard with ease. Not only could Russell jump through the roof, he also quite a pair of wheels on him too. 
                Russell would also compete in the <strong>440 yard race (or 402.3m)</strong> where he finished with a time of <strong>49.6 seconds</strong>. To go along with his extraordinary speed and leaping 
                ability, he also had a <strong>7'4</strong> wingspan.

            <h3>Bill Russell's NBA Run</h3>
            <p>
                If you thought Russell's run in the NBA was smooth, you would be heavily mistaken. Coming into the 1956 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics had the 1st overall pick, but didn't select Russell. Boston forfeited the first pick to select Forward Tommy Heinsohn, with the territorial pick option. This draft option is no longer present in the NBA Draft, but it existed from 1949 to 1965. The NBA would initiate a special rule, which would give teams exclusive rights to claim local college players. This was done to generate more interest in the professional league, as these picks would give fans the chance to watch popular local college players play for their hometown team. As part of the territorial pick rules, Boston had to forefeit their first round pick. Boston's first round pick would end up in the hands of the Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), but they would decide to pass on drafting Russell. Before the draft, Boston Celtic's coach Red Auerbach persuaded the Celtics owner at the time, Walter Brown, to guarantee Rochester owner, Les Harrison, a multitude of lucrative shows performed by the Ice Capade Dancers (to which Brown was a partial owner of). The Ice Capades were traveling entertainment shows that would feature theatrical ice skating performances. In return for providing these shows to Rochester, Harrison and the Rochester Royals would skip Russell with the first pick. However, there were 3 other main reasons why Rochester decided to pass on Russell and select Si Green with the first pick. The first reason included Russell's delayed arrival and debut until late December, as he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team. The second reason was that the Harlem Globetrotters were predicted to offer Russell a huge contract offer for his services. The third reason was that there was some doubt among a variety of pro coaches that Russell would star in the professional game as he did so in college. Even with Rochester not selecting Russell, Boston wasn't out of the dark yet. The Saint Louis Hawks had the second pick, and they actually did select Russell. However, a few days before the draft, the Celtics and Hawks agreed to a deal that would send All-Star Ed Macauley and draft rights to Cliff Hagan in return for the second overall pick. Russell would technically be picked by the Hawks, but sent to Boston right after. With Russell now secured, the Celtics looked like an entirely different team.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The season prior to the addition of Russell, the Celtics finished with a 39-33 record but didn't make much noise in the playoffs, as they were defeated by the Syracuse Nationals in 3 games. The Celtics also had the third worst defense in the league finishing, 6th out of 8 in defensive rating. With the addition of Russell, the Celtics finished with a 44-28 record and had the best defense in the league, finishing 1st out of 8.
