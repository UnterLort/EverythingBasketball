                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>
                    This man goes by many names. "The Dipper", "The Stilt", and even "The Record Book", are all nicknames that belong to the most dominant player in NBA History, Wilton Norman Chamberlain, or Wilt Chamberlain for short. Wilt would go on to have an astonishing NBA Career, but the question remains, how did it all start? In 1953, Chamberlain would begin his Basketball journey at Overbrook High School, located in Philadelphia. As a freshmen, Wilt was already <strong>6ft 11in</strong>. Prior to Basketball, Wilt was a track and field athlete. Wilt would be known as the star player on the Overbrook Panthers Basketball team. According to the ESPN journalist, by the name of Hal Bock, he described Chamberlain as "scary, flat out frightening ... before he came along, very few players at the center position possessed his level of athleticism, stature, and stamina. Chamberlain changed the game in fundamental ways no other player did." It was here where Chamberlain's three lifelong nicknames "Wilt the Stilt", "Goliath", and his personal favorite, "The Big Dipper". Chamberlain would go on to lead the team to two city championships, and during a 3 season stretch at Overbrook, recorded a <strong>56-3</strong> win-loss record. Wilt would go on to break Tom Gola's Philadelphia high school scoring record and would graduate with <strong>2,252</strong> points, as he would average <strong>37.4</strong> points per game.
                    
                    During the 1953 Overbrook season, Chamberlain would average <strong>31</strong> points per game, and would lead his team to a <strong>71-62</strong> win over Northeast High School of Guy Rodgers, who would become a future teammate of Wilt's in the NBA. Wilt would score <strong>34 points</strong> as his Overbrook Panthers won the Philadelphia Public League title and would gain a berth in the city championship game against the winner of the rival Catholic league, the West Catholic High School. In that game against West Catholic, Chamberlain would be quadruple-teamed during the entire game, and even with his 29 point contribution, Overbrook would lose <strong>54-42</strong>.

                    During his second season at Overbrook, Chamberlain continued to display his productive scoring when he set a high school record <strong>71</strong> points against Roxborough. The Panthers would secure the Public League title once more, after defeating Northeast again. During this game, Chamberlain had <strong>40</strong> points, and would later go on to win the city title by beating South Catholic <strong>74-50</strong>, in a game where Chamberlain had scored <strong>32</strong> points, and led the Overbrook Panthers to a <strong>19-0</strong> season.
                    
                    In Chamberlain's third and final season at Overbrook, Chamberlain would continue to display his impressive high scoring ability, as he recorded a <strong>74, 78, and 90</strong> points in three consecutive games. Unlike the previous season, the Panthers would suffer a single loss, falling to Farrell High <strong>59-58</strong>. Overbrook would win the Public League for a third time, as they beat West Philadelphia <strong>78-60</strong>. Waiting for them in the championship game was a familiar foe, West Catholic. Chamberlain would go on to score <strong>35</strong> points and led Overbrook to beat West Catholic <strong>83-42</strong>. For his efforts, Chamberlain would be retroactively honored as Mr. Basketball USA for 1955, fairly early for the selection.

                    In 1953, while still only a sophomore in high school, Chamberlain won his first championship. He would lead the Christian Street YMCA to the title in the national YMCA tournament in High Point, North Carolina, as they would beat the local favorite and the defending champion High Point team <strong>85-79</strong>. Chamberlain would be the youngest member of the team. At 16 and 17, Chamberlain would play in several games for the semi-professional Quakertown Fays, under the pseudonym, George Marcus.

                    Chamberlain would go on to attend the University of Kansas, and continue his basketball journey. On December 3rd, 1956, Chamberlain would make his varsity basketball debut as the center for the Kansas Jayhawks. In his first game as a Kansas Jayhawk, Wilt scored <strong>52</strong> points and pulled in <strong>31</strong> rebounds, which broke two all-time Kansas records in a <strong>87-69</strong> win against the Northwestern Wildcats, which would feature Chamberlains future NBA teammate, Joe Ruklick. Chamberlain would lead a talented group of starters, which included Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky, and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks would go <strong>13-1</strong>. Their only loss came against the Oklahoma State Cowboys with a final score of <strong>56-54</strong>. Chamberlain would be named to first-team All-American. By this time, Chamberlain had developed many aspects of his game, which included his finger roll, his fadeaway jumper which he could also make as a bank shot, his passing ability, and his shot-blocking.
                    
                    Chamberlain's Jayhawks would be one out of twenty-three teams to be selected to play in the 1957 NCAA Basketball Tournament. The Midwest Regional was to be held in Dallas, Texas, which at the time was segregated. In the first game of the tournament, the Jayhawks played an all-white SMU Mustangs. Kansas University would win the game <strong>73-65</strong> in overtime. The next game came against Oklahoma City and Kansas would win once more with a final score of <strong>81-61</strong>. Into the semi-finals the Jayhawks went, and waiting for them was the two-time defending champions, the San Francisco Dons. Chamberlain would lead the way with <strong>32</strong> points, <strong>11</strong> rebounds, and reportedly having at least <strong>7</strong> blocks, as he helped to lead the Jayhawks to defeat the Dons, <strong>80-56</strong>. Since Chamberlain's performance led Kansas to an incredible lead, he would sit on the bench for the final 3:45 left to go in the game.
                    
                    The NCAA Finals would see Chamberlain's 2nd-ranked Jayhawks versus the 1st-ranked, undefeated North Carolina Tar Heels, who would be led by the All-American and National Player of the Year, Lennie Rosenbluth. During the game, the Tar Heels head coach, Frank McGuire (who would one day coach Wilt), used some unorthodox methods to counter Wilt's dominance. For the tip-off, McGuire would send in the shortest player on the roster, Tommy Kearns, in order to annoy Chamberlain. The Tar Heels would then spend the rest of the night triple-teaming Wilt, with one defender in front, one in the back, and another one coming in as soon as he got possession of the ball. With the Heels focus on slowing down Chamberlain, the Jayhawks would only shoot a terrible <strong>27%</strong> from the field, opposed to the Heels themselves, who shot <strong>64%</strong> from the field. At halftime, the Jayhawks were down <strong>22-29</strong>. With 10 minutes remaining, North Carolina would lead 40-37 and would play a game of keep away by passing the ball around with no intention of scoring. After the Heel's committed several turnovers, before they knew it, the game was all tied up at <strong>46</strong> a piece by the end of regulation. Both North Carolina and Kansas would score two points in the first overtime, while Kansas would proceed to freeze the ball, keeping the score tied at <strong>48</strong>, in the second overtime. Then in the third overtime, the Heels would score two consecutive baskets, however Chamberlain responded with a 3-point play, which would leave Kansas trailing 52-51. After Chamberlain scored a basket, Kansas would now have a one point lead. With only 10 seconds remaining, Heels' center Joe Quigg would pump fake, then proceed to drive to the rim. Meeting him there was Chamberlain, who blocked Quigg's shot. However, it was also called for a foul. Quigg would proceed to knock down both free throws, putting the Heel's up <strong>54-53</strong>. For the last play of the game, Harp (who was coaching Chamberlain after Phog Allen retired), called for Ron to inbound the ball to Chamberlain in the low post. However, the pass would be tipped by Quigg, and would be recovered, and the Tar Heels would win the game. Even with the defeat, Chamberlain's <strong>23</strong> points and <strong>14</strong> rebounds, helped to earn him the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Many comments would begin to surface that the loss deeply bothered Chamberlain, as this wasn't the first time Chamberlain's team lost, even though he put up impressive numbers. Chamberlain would confirm these comments by saying it was the most painful loss of his life. However, he did achieve history as that national final was the only final to ever go into 3 overtimes.
                    
                    With Chamberlain heading into his junior year, the matchups the Jayhawks' faced proved to be more frustrating for Wilt. Understanding how talented Wilt was, opposing teams resorted to freeze ball tactics, in order to keep Wilt's scoring to a minimum. Chamberlain would still average <strong>30.1</strong> points for the season and help lead his Jayhawks to an <strong>18-5</strong> record, however three of those losses came when Wilt was out with a urinary infection. Due to Kansas finishing second in the league, and at the time only conference winners were invited to the NCAA Tournament, the season would end for the Jayhawk's there. Chamberlain would still be named an All-American, along with future NBA Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor of Seattle University and Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, to go along with Chamberlain's old rival Guy Rodgers, who was now playing for Temple University.
                    
                    Chamberlain would lose his enjoyment from NCAA Basketball and in an attempt to earn some money, he left college in search of a sum of $10,000, while NBA players were earning $9,000 for the whole season. In the two seasons Chamberlain spent at Kansas University, he would average <strong>29.9</strong> points and <strong>18.3</strong> rebounds per game, tallying a total of <strong>1,433</strong> points and <strong>877</strong> rebounds, and would ultimately lead Kansas to one Big Seven championship. Shockingly enough, before Chamberlain turned 21, he had already been featured in American magazines such as Time, Life, Look, and Newsweek.
                    
                    With the NBA not accepting players until after they had completed college and graduated, Chamberlain would have to go pro, but in a different manner. Chamberlain would famously sign with the esteemed Harlem Globetrotters and play for them in 1958, for a sum of $50,000. Over the next coming years, Chamberlain would join the Globetrotters commonly in the off-season. Chamberlain would fondly remember his time with Harlem as he was no longer ridiculed at or pressured to break records, but rather was a part of a bunch of talented artists who enjoyed to entertain the crowd. On March 9 of 2000, Chamberlain's No. 13 jersey was retired by the Globetrotters.

                <h3>Wilt Chamberlain's NBA Run</h3>
                <p>
                    Chamberlain's NBA Career would begin in the 1959-60 season, as he was drafted in the 1959 NBA Draft with the territorial selection (3rd Pick, 3rd Overall, in the 1st Round) by the Philadelphia Warriors. Chamberlain would join a Philadelphia Warriors team, coached by Neil Johnston, that included himself, guard Tom Gola, forward Paul “Pitchin” Arizin, guard Ernie Beck, and a familiar face, guard Guy Rodgers. In his first ever NBA game of his career, Chamberlain put up 43 points and 28 rebounds, against the New York Knicks. In his third ever NBA game of his career, Chamberlain recorded <strong>41</strong> points and a then-career-high <strong>40</strong> rebounds in a <strong>124-113</strong> win over the Syracuse Nationals. In Chamberlain's fourth ever NBA game, Chamberlain versed a familiar face, the Celtics Hall of Fame coach, Red Auerbach, (who tried to recruit him years earlier, but never went through). This game would also be the beginning of one of the best known rivalries in all of NBA history (Russell vs Chamberlain). Chamberlain would outscore Russell with <strong>30</strong> points, compared to Russell's <strong>28</strong> points, but Boston would secure the win (which would be quite the common theme for Wilt). November 10th, 1959, Chamberlain would tally <strong>39</strong> points and a new career-high of <strong>43</strong> rebounds in a <strong>126-125</strong> win over the Knicks. On January 25, 1960, Chamberlain would record a rare feat in the NBA, recording at least 50 points and 40 rebounds in an NBA game. During that game specifically, against the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain put up an insane <strong>58</strong> points, <strong>42</strong> rebounds, and <strong>4</strong> assists, which resulted in a win for the Philadelphia Warriors. His <strong>58</strong> points that evening was (at that point) a career high for him, which he would later tie on February 21, as he recorded <strong>58</strong> points with <strong>24</strong> rebounds in a <strong>131-121</strong> win over the Knicks. Interestingly enough, in <strong>71</strong> out of the <strong>72</strong> games Chamberlain played in his rookie season, he scored at least <strong>20</strong> points. There was only <strong>1</strong> game in his rookie season where he didn't put <strong>20</strong> or more points (which was a game in which he achieved only <strong>5</strong> points). Funny enough, this was also the same game where Chamberlain would put up less than double-digit rebounds, tallying only <strong>2</strong>. Like his scoring, over the course of the other <strong>71</strong> games Chamberlain played in his rookie season, he put up at least double-digit rebounding numbers. Over the course of Chamberlain's rookie season, he averaged <strong>37.6</strong> points and <strong>27</strong> rebounds, which convincingly broke the previous regular-season records as a rookie. Chamberlain would only need <strong>56</strong> games to score <strong>2,102</strong> points, breaking the all-time regular-season scoring record of Bob Pettit, who needed <strong>72</strong> games to score <strong>2,101</strong> points (in his rookie season). Chamberlain would break eight NBA records that season, and to go along with that, he was named both Rookie of the Year and the MVP that season. Chamberlain would cap off his rookie season with a selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team, in which he would win the All-Star Game and the All-Star Game MVP award with a <strong>23</strong> point and <strong>25</strong> rebound display. Other standout performances from Wilt's rookie season came during his 14th, 33rd, 64th, and 68th games. His 14th game came against the Boston Celtics where he put up <strong>45</strong> points, <strong>35</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>6</strong> blocks, which resulted in a <strong>123-113</strong> win. His 33rd game came against the Minneapolis Lakers, in which Chamberlain put up <strong>52</strong> points, <strong>20</strong> rebounds, and <strong>10</strong> blocks, which was enough to beat the Lakers with a final score of <strong>126-111</strong>. All of the field goals Wilt made this game were all dunks. In Chamberlain's 64th game was a rematch against the Celtics, in which Chamberlain would put up <strong>53</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>11</strong> blocks to lead the Warriors to a <strong>126-108</strong> victory. Lastly, in Chamberlain's 68th game, which once again came against the Celtics, Chamberlain recorded <strong>39</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>14</strong> blocks. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be enough as Boston won with a final score of <strong>133-119</strong>. The Warriors would head into the 1960 NBA playoffs, and waiting for them in the first round was the <strong>45-30</strong> Syracuse Nationals. The Warriors would easily handle them in <strong>3</strong> games, which would set up a matchup versus the Eastern Division champions, the Boston Celtics. This would be one of many playoffs loses Chamberlain would face verse the Celtics. Red Auerbach had instructed forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain. So whenever the Warriors would be shooting foul shots, Heinsohn would proceed to grab and shove Chamberlain, in order to prevent him from using his immense speed to recover on defense. The intention of this was that the Celtics would proceed to throw the ball in fast enough, while Wilt was not underneath his own basket, allowing for a ton of easy fastbreak baskets. The teams would split the series in the first two games. However, with Chamberlain's frustrations with Heinsohn hounding him all game, he would proceed to punch Heinsohn during the third game of the series. As a result of the scuffle, Chamberlain would injure his hand, and Philadelphia would proceed to lose the next two games. With his hand recovered from the punch, Chamberlain would return for the fifth game of the series and contributed <strong>50</strong> points and <strong>35</strong> rebounds in a <strong>128-107</strong> win for Philadelphia over Boston, which would extend the series to a sixth game. It would ultimately be Heinsohn who would put the game, and series away, as he scored the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in, resulting in the Warriors losing the series <strong>4-2</strong>.

                    Being fed up with the constant double or even triple teams, and teams coming down on him with hard personal fouls, Chamberlain would shock the Warrior nation as he announced considering retirement. Chamberlain was also concerned that he would lose his cool one day, if he continued to play against double and triple teams and being constantly fouled hard by other teams. To put into perspective the amount of hard fouls Wilt was going up against night in and night out, the Celtic forward Tom Heinsohn was quoted to say "Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever." Team Executive Edward "Eddie" Gottlieb would persuade Chamberlain back into returning to the NBA, as he raised Chamberlain's salary to $65,000.

                    Chamberlain would start his 1960-61 season with a <strong>42</strong>-point and <strong>31</strong>-rebound display in a <strong>133-123</strong> winning effort against the Syracuse Nationals. On November 24th, 1960, Chamberlain would make NBA history as he set the record for the most rebounds by a player in a single game, as he grabbed an insane <strong>55</strong> rebounds, to go along with <strong>34</strong> points, <strong>4</strong> assists, and even <strong>8</strong> blocks, against Bill Russell and the Celtics. However, Wilt fell short once again as Russell and the Celtics would prevail over the Warriors, winning the game <strong>132-129</strong>. On November 29, Chamberlain recorded <strong>44</strong> points, <strong>38</strong> rebounds, and a then-career-high <strong>7</strong> assists in a <strong>122-121</strong> win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Chamberlain would improve from his rookie season statistics, as he averaged <strong>38.4</strong> points and <strong>27.2</strong> rebounds per game that season. Chamberlain would become the first player to break the <strong>3,000</strong>-point barrier, and is still is the first and only player to break the <strong>2,000</strong>-rebound barrier for a single season, grabbing <strong>2,149</strong> rebounds that season. Chamberlain was also handed his first field goal percentage title as he hit a mind blowing <strong>50.9%</strong> of his field goals over the course of the season. Chamberlain was especially dominant this season for his Warriors as he scored near <strong>32%</strong> of his teams points and grabbed <strong>30.4%</strong> of the Warriors rebounds. Wilt would once again have a multitude of standout performances over the course of the season. In a game against the Cincinnati Royals on November 1st, 1960, Chamberlain put up <strong>33</strong> points, <strong>25</strong> rebounds, and <strong>9</strong> blocks in a <strong>131-113</strong> win. On November 4th, 1960, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain recorded <strong>44</strong> points, <strong>39</strong> rebounds, <strong>3</strong> assists, and <strong>12</strong> blocks in a <strong>136-121</strong> victory. On November 10th, 1960, Chamberlain recorded <strong>22</strong> points, <strong>30</strong> rebounds, <strong>6</strong> assists, and <strong>10</strong> blocks in a <strong>116-112</strong> win over the New York Knicks. Lastly, on February 5th, 1961, Chamberlain once again torch the Knicks with <strong>55</strong> points, <strong>29</strong> rebounds, <strong>1</strong> assist, and <strong>8</strong> blocks in a <strong>136-128</strong> win. Shockingly enough, those <strong>8</strong> blocks came in only the first quarter of play, meaning if he kept that same pace, he was on track to have recorded <strong>32</strong> blocks that game. Chamberlain's regular season success wouldn't translate to the post-season as the Warriors were eliminated by the Syracuse Nationals, in a three-game sweep. Comments then began to surface about Chamberlain being "difficult" and him not respecting coach Johnston, who made it clear that he could not handle the star center.

                    Whenever someone brings up Wilt, one of the most popular things he is praised for is his 1961-62 campaign. To put it simply, Chamberlain steamrolled the league on an individual level. With the replacement of coach Johnston with Frank McGuire, who Wilt played against in the triple overtime loss in the NCAA championship against the Tar Heels, that McGuire was coaching. In that season, Chamberlain would set several all-time records, which have never been challenged. Chamberlain would average an insane <strong>50.4</strong> points and <strong>25.7</strong> rebounds. Even more famous was his legendary game that came on March 2, 1962, in the Hershey Arena, located in Philadelphia. Most people know what game this was, this was the game where Wilt Chamberlain would score <strong>100</strong> points on his own to lead the Warriors to a <strong>169-147</strong> win over the New York Knicks. In that game, Chamberlain not only put up <strong>100</strong> points, he also secured <strong>25</strong> rebounds and <strong>2</strong> assists. On this night, Chamberlain notched a total of <strong>8</strong> records for the NBA record book. Those records included: Most points in a single game (<strong>100</strong>), Most points scored in a half (<strong>59</strong> points in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals made in a game (<strong>36</strong>), Most field goals attempted in a game (<strong>63</strong>), Most field goals made in a half (<strong>22</strong> in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals attempted in a half (<strong>37</strong> in the <strong>2nd</strong> half), Most field goals attempted in a quarter (<strong>21</strong> in the <strong>4th</strong> quarter), Most free throws made in a game (<strong>28</strong>). This game was also part of an incredible streak, where Chamberlain scored at least <strong>60</strong> points in <strong>3</strong> consecutive games, and the <strong>4th</strong> game in that streak was this one, with <strong>100</strong> points. That streak in itself is an NBA record for the Most consecutive <strong>60</strong> -point games with a total of <strong>4</strong>. Also, Wilt Chamberlain is the only player to ever score <strong>60</strong> points in back-to-back games, which is a personal and league record. 
                    
                    Additional records Chamberlain set in this season included: Most <strong>50</strong> -point games with <strong>45</strong>, Most <strong>40</strong> -point games in a season with <strong>63</strong>, Most consecutive <strong>50</strong> -point games with <strong>7</strong> (spanning from December 16-29, 1961), Most consecutive <strong>40</strong> -point games with <strong>14</strong> (spanning from December 8-30, and January 11 to February 1, 1962), Most consecutive <strong>30</strong> -point games with <strong>65</strong> (spanning from November 4, 1961 to February 22, 1962), Most consecutive <strong>20</strong> -point games with <strong>126</strong> (spanning from October 19, 1961 to January 19, 1963), Most consecutive games leading all players in scoring with <strong>40</strong> games in the 1961-62 season, Most field goals made in a season with <strong>1,597</strong> in 1961-62, Most field goals attempted in a season with <strong>3,159</strong> in 1961-62, Most free throws attempted in a season with <strong>1,363</strong> in 1961-62, Most field goal attempts in a game with <strong>48</strong> (against the Syracuse Nationals on March 22, 1962), Most field goal attempts in a five-game series with <strong>159</strong> (against the Syracuse Nationals in 1962), Free throw attempts in a game with <strong>16</strong> in 1962, Most minutes played in a season with <strong>3,882</strong> in 1961-62, Most minutes played per game for a season with <strong>48.53</strong> in 1961-62, Most complete games in a season with <strong>79</strong> out of <strong>80</strong> games in 1961-62, Most consecutive complete games in a season with <strong>47</strong> in 1961-62, and the Most points scored in a single season with a total of <strong>4,029</strong> in 1961-62. Wilt's <strong>4,029</strong> regular-season point total made him the only player to break the <strong>4,000</strong> -point mark. Chamberlain would also once again break the <strong>2,000</strong> rebound mark with <strong>2,052</strong>. Chamberlain would also go on to score <strong>42</strong> points in the NBA All-Star game that season, which was a record at the time, but has sense been broken. 
                    
                    Chamberlain's Warriors would meet the Celtics once more in the playoffs that season. A Celtic team that both Bob Cousy and Bill Russell deemed the greatest Celtic team of all-time. Each team would win their games on their home floor, so the series would be split at three, after six games. In a heavily contested seventh game, Chamberlain would go on to tie the game at <strong>107</strong> with only <strong>16</strong> seconds remaining. However, Celtic guard Sam Jones had other plans, as he would a clutch shot with only <strong>2</strong> seconds left to win the series for Boston. In the coming years, Chamberlain would often face a lot of criticism for averaging <strong>50</strong> points for a season, as many saw it as selfish to score that much, and even with his extreme average of points, he didn't win the title, so people also used that to criticize Chamberlain. Coming to Chamberlain's defense was coach McGuire who stated that "Wilt has been simply super-human" and proceeded to comment on how the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer, a playmaker, and a second center or forward to take pressure off of Chamberlain.

                <h3>Wilt Chamberlain's Supreme Athleticism</h3>
                <p>
                    Before diving in to Wilt Chamberlain's inhuman like athleticism, it is important to note that Wilt has a case for being the greatest athlete in not just NBA history, but also in human history. While Wilt was still in high school, he got to display his amazing athletic abilities through track and field, as that was his original passion, before turning to Basketball. In high school, Wilt Chamberlain high jumped <strong>6 feet and 6 inches</strong>, he ran <strong>440 yards</strong> in <strong>49 seconds</strong>. His shotput was measured at <strong>53 feet and 4 inches</strong>, and Chamberlain would broad jumped <strong>22 feet</strong>. These measurements were incredibly impressive, considering the fact that these feats were achieved by a <strong>6 feet 11 inch</strong> high school student. Even when Wilt turned to Basketball, he would continue his track dominance while in college at Kansas University. While at Kansas, Wilt would run a <strong>40-yard</strong> dash in <strong>4.6</strong> seconds. According to eye witnesses, Wilt was barefoot in that sprint. To apply some more perspective into how impressive that is, LeBron James would run at that speed in 2012, which was when he was still in his prime, while in shoes. At an event, Wilt Chamberlain would be challenged by Hall of Famer NFL FB Jim Brown to a foot race. For those who don't know who that is, Jim Brown is considered one of, if not the greatest running back in NFL history. He was extremely effective in his role on the football field, as he was tasked with running with the football, which was something that he was the best at ever doing. According to those who witnessed the race, Wilt beat him comfortably in the foot race. Frustrated with the loss, Jim would challenege Wilt to a rematch, Wilt would accept and would beat him a second time. Wilt Chamberlain in college would be as fast, if not faster, than a prime LeBron James. Wilt would run a <strong>100-yard</strong> dash in <strong>10.9</strong> seconds, shot putted <strong>56 feet</strong>, triple jumped over <strong>50 feet</strong> and would go on to win the high jump in the Big 8 Track and Field Championships three years in a row. Wilt's teammates have said that Wilt could jump so high that he was able to grab quarters off the top of the backboard. Being able to do this as a man of his stature is something that is completely unheard of. Chamberlain was also known to be freakishly strong. On several different occasions people said they witnessed Wilt benchpress <strong>500</strong> pounds, however Wilt himself said he could do <strong>600</strong> pounds. Wilt could deadlift <strong>625</strong> pounds and clean-and-jerk nearly <strong>400</strong> pounds. Paul Silas, who was a former opponent of Chamberlain in the NBA recalled a time where Wilt Chamberlain picked him up and turned him around during a Basketball game. To put that in perspective, Paul was <strong>6 feet 7 inches</strong> tall and weighed <strong>235</strong> pounds. Bob Lanier, who was a <strong>6 foot and 10 inch</strong> center who weighed <strong>270</strong> pounds would be asked in a questionnaire about what was his most memorable moment of his career and Lanier would respond by recalling a time where Wilt Chamberlain picked him up and moved him like a coffee cup, in order to get into a favorable position on the court. If that isn't enough to put his athletic abilities into perspective, there was another quality that was touched upon before during the 1961-62 NBA season description. That was how Wilt Chamberlain averaged <strong>48.5</strong> minutes per game that season. Those are more minutes than there are in a standard <strong>48</strong> minute game. However, it was possible for Chamberlain to accomplish this due to the amount of overtime games he would play that season that would increase his minutes per game (to go along with the fact that he played in 79 complete games that season) just shows how much stamina he truly had. To add to Wilt's impressive athletic abilities, he also had a <strong>7 foot 8 inch</strong> wingspan. Wilt had the speed of Lebron James, more power than Shaquille O'Neal, and the ability to leap through the roof (and even a little bit higher) like a prime Russell Westbrook.

                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, Bill Russell had a slow start to his basketball career. In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills and fundamentals of the game as 
                    he had difficulty understanding the game of basketball. This resulted in him being cut from multiple basketball teams at during his time in highschool. It 
                    wouldn't be until Russell caught the attention of a college recruiter by the name of Hal DeJulio that his basketball career would fully take off. Hal was quick to 
                    notice Russell's poor fundamentals and small scoring touch, but he also noticed that Russell had a unforeseen instinct for the game, especially when it came to his 
                    performance in the clutch. This would be a common theme for Russell once he got to the league. Hal would offer Russell a scholarship to the University of San 
                    Francisco, to which Russell excitedly accepted. Russell knew that this was his chance to escape the constant poverty and racism and Russell said himself that he swore 
                    he would make the best of the opportunity. At USF, Russell would become his teams (San Francisco Dons) new starting center, as he stood at 6 feet 10 inches tall. 
                    Russell's extraordinary defensive talent fit well with coach Phil Woolperts focus on defense and calculated half-court play. During his 3 years at USF, Russell 
                    accumulated a number of accolades and achievements. Russell was not only a basketball player at USF, but he was additionally a track and field athlete. It was here 
                    that Russell got to demonstrate his outstanding athleticism, that still seem impossible to achieve today, let alone back in the 50s.

                <h3>Russell's Insane Athleticism</h3>
                <p>
                    To further emphasize Russell's supurb athletic abilites, it is key to look at his frame. Russell was <strong>6'10</strong> and weighed around <strong>230</strong> pounds in his prime physical form. At USF in his graduation year (1956), he competed in the high jump at the West Coast Relays. Russell would achieve a high jump measured at <strong>6 feet 9 and 1/4 inches (or 2.06m)</strong>, which placed him as the <strong>2nd</strong> highest jumper in the United States and <strong>7th</strong> in the whole world. Russell also remarked saying that in his playing days, he could get his eyes above the rim and touch the top of the backboard with ease. Not only could Russell jump through the roof, he also quite a pair of wheels on him too. Russell would also compete in the <strong>440 yard race (or 402.3m)</strong> where he finished with a time of <strong>49.6 seconds</strong>. To go along with his extraordinary speed and leaping ability, he also had a <strong>7'4</strong> wingspan.

                <h3>Bill Russell's NBA Run</h3>
                <p>
                    If you thought Russell's run in the NBA was smooth, you would be heavily mistaken. Coming into the 1956 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics had the 1st overall pick, but didn't select Russell. Boston forfeited the first pick to select Forward Tommy Heinsohn, with the territorial pick option. This draft option is no longer present in the NBA Draft, but it existed from 1949 to 1965. The NBA would initiate a special rule, which would give teams exclusive rights to claim local college players. This was done to generate more interest in the professional league, as these picks would give fans the chance to watch popular local college players play for their hometown team. As part of the territorial pick rules, Boston had to forefeit their first round pick. Boston's first round pick would end up in the hands of the Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), but they would decide to pass on drafting Russell. Before the draft, Boston Celtic's coach Red Auerbach persuaded the Celtics owner at the time, Walter Brown, to guarantee Rochester owner, Les Harrison, a multitude of lucrative shows performed by the Ice Capade Dancers (to which Brown was a partial owner of). The Ice Capades were traveling entertainment shows that would feature theatrical ice skating performances. In return for providing these shows to Rochester, Harrison and the Rochester Royals would skip Russell with the first pick. However, there were 3 other main reasons why Rochester decided to pass on Russell and select Si Green with the first pick. The first reason included Russell's delayed arrival and debut until late December, as he was a member of the U.S. Olympic team. The second reason was that the Harlem Globetrotters were predicted to offer Russell a huge contract offer for his services. The third reason was that there was some doubt among a variety of pro coaches that Russell would star in the professional game as he did so in college. Even with Rochester not selecting Russell, Boston wasn't out of the dark yet. The Saint Louis Hawks had the second pick, and they actually did select Russell. However, a few days before the draft, the Celtics and Hawks agreed to a deal that would send All-Star Ed Macauley and draft rights to Cliff Hagan in return for the second overall pick. Russell would technically be picked by the Hawks, but sent to Boston right after. With Russell now secured, the Celtics looked like an entirely different team, as they not only secured 1, but 3 future Hall Of Famers in 1 draft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The season prior to the addition of Russell, the Celtics finished with a 39-33 record, which placed them 2nd in the NBA Eastern Division, behind the Philadelphia Warriors who finished with a strong 45-27 record, which was the best record in the league that season. However, the Celtics didn't make much noise in the playoffs, as they were defeated by the Syracuse Nationals in 3 games. The Celtics also had the 3rd worst defense in the league finishing, 6th out of 8 in defensive rating. The Philadelphia Warriors would actually go on to win the NBA Championship that season as they were led by a handful of stars including the Hall Of Famers Paul Arizin, Neil Johnston, and Tom Gola. Rounding out that roster included scoring threats like Jack George and Joe Graboski. With this core group of guys, they dismantled the Syracuse Nationals in only 5 games, the same team who had just beaten Boston in the previous round. In those 5 games against Syracuse, 5 players from Philadelphia averaged over double digit points, and 2 averaged over double digit rebounds. Compared to Syracuse who had only 4 players who averaged over double digit points, 1 player who averaged double digit rebounds, and 1 player who averaged over double digit assists. After defeating Syracuse, Philadelphia was set to face off against the Fort Wayne Pistons. Philadelphia would control the pace for the whole series as they beat Fort Wayne in 5 games (4-1).
                    
                    With the main addition of Russell, and Tommy Heinsohn, the Celtics finished with a 44-28 record, finishing 1st in the NBA Eastern Division, and having the best record in the league. The Celtics also had the best defense in the league, finishing 1st out of 8. With other players like Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, and Arnie Risen rounding out the roster, the Celtics had a total of 7 future Hall Of Famers on their roster that season. Tommy Heinsohn would earn the Rookie Of The Year Award that year with averages of 16.2 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 1.6 APG. The Celtics would make their way into the playoffs, and waiting for them was a familiar foe, the Syracuse Nationals. However, the outcome was vastly different than last years result. The Celtics would not only avenge their loss to Syracuse from last year, but they dominated them, sweeping them 3-0. In those 3 games, Russell averaged a tame 15.3 PPG and an absurd 28.0 RPG. Heinsohn led the Celtics in PPG average as he put up 20.3 PPG in those 3 games verse Syracuse. Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman also added in their own contributions as Cousy averaged 19.0 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 9.7 APG and Sharman averaged 19.3 PPG and 3.0 RPG over the course of the series. The Celtics would find themselves going up against Hall Of Famer Bob Pettit and the St. Louis Hawks. This Hawks squad was very talented with future Hall Of Famers Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan, Alex Hannum, Ed Macauley, and Slater Martin all on the roster. This series would go to a hard fought 7th game, where the Celtics would pull away with the victory and the championship trophy. Russell put up 19 points, a monsterous 32 rebounds, and blocked 5 shots in the deciding 7th game, securing his 1st of many championships to come. Tommy Heinsohn would lead the Celtics in scoring in the 7th game with 37 points, and for good measure, he secured 23 rebounds.
                    
                    With Boston securing their first championship ring in franchise history, it was only a matter of time until they became the dynasty we know today. In the next years draft, the Celtics secured another future Hall Of Famer, the 6'4 Shooting Guard, Sam Jones. With Sam Jones now secured on the roster, the Celtics would improve their record from the previous season, going from a 44 win team, to a 49 win team. The Celtics finished the regular season with a 49-23 record, which placed them 1st in the Eastern Division, and 1st in the whole league. Russell would have a number of standout performances throughout the regular season, including a game against the Detroit Pistons, where he put up 14 points, 19 rebounds, and an absurd 17 blocks. Less than a week later, Russell would play against the Pistons again, but this time he would put up 15 points, 30 rebounds, and 12 blocks. Then during a matchup with the Philadelphia Warriors, Russell would put up 18 points, 35 rebounds, and 11 blocks. These games resulted in wins for Russell and the Celtics. This season was also Russell's first year as an All-Star, which he would be selected to often during the majority of his career. The Celtics would head into the playoffs and their first matchup would be with the Philadelphia Warriors. This series wouldn't be too much to handle for Boston as they beat the Warriors 4-1. Russell would have standout performances in Game 3 and Game 5 of the series. In Game 3, Russell put up 14 points and an insane 40 rebounds to bring Boston the win at the Boston Garden. In Game 5 to close out the series, Russell put up 18 points and 30 rebounds to win the series for the Celtics at the Boston Garden. Heading into the NBA Finals the Celtics were set to play a familiar foe, the Saint Louis Hawks. However, this series would prove to be a lot different then last season's finals. In the first two games, each team split at 1-1, but in Game 3, Russell would go down with a foot injury, which heavily changed the course of the series. Russell would return for Game 6, but the Celtics were already down 2-3. Russell didn't see much playing time, as he only played 20 minutes. The Hawks would come out victorious in the deciding Game 6, with their superstar Bob Pettit who dropped 50 points and 19 rebounds to win the game by 1 point for the Hawks. Still to this very day, this championship is the only championship the hawks had ever won.

                    Luckily for Boston, they would once again gain another fantastic piece to their roster in the off-season. Drafted alongside Bill Russell, and Tom Heinsohn, in '56 the Celtics would also draft future Hall-Of-Famer, K.C Jones. However, Jones wouldn't begin playing for them until 1958 as he would serve two years in the military and would play some exhibition games as a defensive back for the Los Angeles Rams, until he would suffer a leg injury, causing him to quit the sport. He then would head to the Boston training camp to begin his NBA career. With established Boston backcourt guards like Bob Cousy and Bill Sharman already on the roster, K.C wouldn't see much of the floor as he played a reserve roll during his rookie year. He would operate as the backup to Cousy 12 to 13 minutes per game and averaged 3.5 points. K.C fit perfectly in Boston's system and was able to make the most of the opportunity by winning 8x championships with the Celtics. K.C's minutes would continue to increase progressively throughout the coming seasons, and when Bob Cousy retired, K.C. would average 30.3 minutes per game in the 1963-64 season. From 1964-65 to 1966-67, K.C. would average 32.2 minutes per game while also averaging 7.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists on 39.3% field goal percentage and 65.5% free throw percentage. K.C. would remain as the Celtics main point guard for the rest of his career. With the main addition of K.C., the Celtics finished with a 52-20 record, which was the best record in the Eastern Division and the whole league. Boston would head into the playoffs and waiting for them in the Eastern Division finals was the 35-37 Syracuse Nationals, who would take Boston to 7 games before being eliminated by the Celtics. Boston would then go on to verse the 33-39 Minneapolis Lakers. The Minneapolis Lakers would be led by their star rookie and future Hall of Famer, Elgin Baylor, who averaged 24.9 points per game, 15.0 rebounds per game, and 4.1 assists per game in the regular season and 25.5 points per game, 12.0 rebounds per game, and 3.3 assists per game in the playoffs. In the finals, Baylor would average 22.8 points per game, and 11.8 rebounds per game in the series. With other future Hall of Famers Vern Mikkelsen and Slick Leonard on the roster, the Lakers definitely had the talent to put up a fight against Boston, but ultimately couldn't put it all together, which resulted in them getting swept. This would be quite the common theme for the Lakers as they would fall short to the Celtics a total of 6 times in the finals during the 60s. This matchup would also mark the beginning of one of the best rivalries in all of American sports, the Celtics and the Lakers. This championship would also kick start a streak for the Celtics as from 1959 to 1966, they would go on to win a record 8 straight championships, beating the lakers an additional 4 times in that stretch. No team in NBA history has ever won 4 or more rings in a row besides the 60s Celtics. The Celtics also beat the St. Louis Hawks twice and the San Francisco Warriors once during their 8 consecutive championship runs. During the Celtics 8 consecutive title runs, they would continue to add future Hall of Fame talent to the roster. In the 1960 NBA Draft, the Celtics selected Tom "Satch" Sanders, who would be a player who would constantly rotate between the starting lineup and a spot of the bench. Sanders was a well known defender standing at 6'6 at the wing who would be tasked in guarding some of the most talented wings in the league like Elgin Baylor and many others. No matter if it was in the starting lineup or a supporting role off the bench, Sanders always seemed to be one of the difference makers in the outcome of games. In the 1961-62 season, the Celtics acquired the 6'5 point guard/shooting guard and future Hall of Famer, Carl Braun. By the time the Celtics added Braun to the roster, he was 34 years old and past his prime years, which he spent in New York. He played only 48 games, and played for only an average of 8.6 minutes per game that season. He didn't contribute much to the team, but nonetheless, adding an additional future Hall of Famer to the roster definitely is something to shy away from. Heading into the 1962-63 season, the Celtics would acquire future Hall of Famer John "Hondo" Havlicek in the 1962 NBA Draft with the 9th pick in the 1st round. Havlicek was a 6'5 small forward/shooting guard who was known to have remarkable athleticism, speed, skill, and intelligence. During his rookie year, Havlicek would come off the bench and put up solid all around numbers of 14.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game on 44.5% field goal efficiency and 72.8% free throw efficiency. Havlicek would continue to develop during the coming seasons and would find himself in the starting lineup in no time. Despite the rich Celtic history, Havlicek would become (and still remains) as the Celtics all time leading scorer in the regular season with 26,395 points. Havlicek would eventually become the key and best player on the Celtic teams in the 70s as he would help them win 2 more championships, tallying to a grand total of 8 total championships for Havlicek on his resume. Havlicek would also become the 1973-74 Finals MVP as the Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks in 7 games. One of Havlicek's best moments would come on April 15th, 1965, where the Celtics were facing elimination by Wilt Chamberlain and the Philadelphia 76ers. Nearing the very end of the 4th quarter, the 76ers were down 107-110. Wilt would go on to dunk the ball, officially scoring the last 10 points for the 76ers and bringing the lead down to 1 point. Bill Russell would take the ball out of bounds to inbound. However, when Russell went to inbound the ball, it hit a wire, which then deflected the ball out of bounds, giving the possession back to Philadelphia under their own basket. After the Celtics had called a timeout, Hal Greer (another Future Hall of Famer) would take the ball out of bounds to inbound it. Once the player is given the ball by the referee, they have 5 seconds to inbound the ball. If the inbounder still has the ball when 5 seconds have passed, the ball goes to the opponent. When reflecting on this moment, Havlicek would go on to say that whne the official handed the ball to Greer, he bagan counting in his head, from 1000 to 1005. Havlicek said that once he reached 1004, he knew that Greer was looking for Chet Walker (another future Hall of Famer), so he turned his head slightly to peak at the direction of the pass and once he saw the ball coming, he intercepted the pass and stole the ball, putting the game away for Boston and helping them to move on to the NBA Finals. Havlicek said that in that moment, the events that played out felt like it was in slow motion for him, which is why he was able to react quickly on the inbound pass to Walker from Greer. Johnny Most (who was a famous American Sports Announcer and was primarily known for his gravelly radio voice for the Boston Celtics from 1953 to 1990) was the radio announcer during this game and when Havlicek stole the ball, he shouted in excitement, which has become one of the most popular sports announcer moments in history. On April 9th, 1978, Havlicek would play the last game of his career and announce his retirement from the league. The Celtics would also acquire the 6'9 center, Clyde Lovellette, who would also be a future Hall of Famer. Like Braun, the Celtics acquired Lovellette during the twilight years of his career. Lovellette would spend the prime of his career playing for the Lakers, Cincinnati Royals, and St. Louis Hawks. During his prime years, he was a 20 point per game scorer, while also averaging 11.3 rebounds per game, to go along with 1.9 assists per game. During his time in Boston, he would only average 6.6 points per game, 2.9 rebounds, and 0.5 assists per game, while also playing an average of 9.5 minutes per game. He manly served as a backup center off the bench for Boston during his two seasons there.

                    In the 1963-64 season, the Celtics acquired the 6'6 small forward/power forward Willie Naulls from the San Francisco Warriors and the 6'3 point guard/shooting guard Larry Siegfried from the Cincinnati Royals. Willie was past his prime years with New York, but still chipped in 10.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, while playing an average of nearly 20 minutes per game (19.6 minutes per game respectively) during the 3 seasons he spent in Boston. Luckily for Boston, Siegfried was a rookie when he was added to the roster and would develop into a solid guard for them. He only chipped in 3.3 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game during that season as he played only 8.4 minutes per game and played in only 31 games. Siegfried would develop into a 13.4 points per game scorer, to go along with 3.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game during his prime years in Boston, while also playing 27.9 minutes per game.

                    Heading into the 1964-65 season, the Celtics were pretty tame with additions to their roster. In the 1964 NBA Draft, the Celtics selected the 7'0 center/power forward Mel Counts with the 9th pick in the 1st round, who was another solid role player off the bench, putting up 6.8 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, along with 0.6 assists per game in the 121 games he played for Boston, while playing only 13.2 minutes per game. Mel wasn’t known for his time in Boston, but by him being on the right team at the right time, being in Boston made him a 2x NBA Champion. The Celtics also selected Ron Bonham in the 1964 NBA Draft with the 9th pick in the 2nd round. In a total of 76 games played for Boston, Ron put up 6.3 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 0.4 assists per game as another role player off the bench as he only averaged 9.0 minutes per game during his time in Boston. The Celtics then also took the 6’10 center/power forward and future Hall of Famer, John Thompson with the 9th pick, in the 3rd round of the 1964 NBA Draft. Although he is a Hall of Famer, he only played 74 games in his NBA Career with Boston, averaging 3.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 0.3 assists per game, in only 10.4 minutes played per game. Like Mel, John was another case of being on the right team at the right time, so even though he spent two seasons in Boston and for his whole NBA Career, it made him a 2x Champion. Boston also acquired the 6’4 shooting guard Gerry Ward through a trade and averaged 1.7 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 2.0 assists in only 10.0 minutes played per game. He also played only 3 games for Boston. The Celtics also had the 6’10 center/power forward Bevo Nordmann on the roster at the start of the season. But much like Ward, Nordmann only played 3 games for Boston as he put up 2.0 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.0 assist per game in only 8.3 minutes played per game.

                    Heading into the 1965-66 season, the Celtics would make some more exciting additions to their roster. The Celtics would acquire the 6’6 small forward/power forward and future Hall of Famer Don Nelson, after he had been waived out of the league. Nelson would spend the rest of his career with the Celtics, which made him a 5x Champion. During his time in Boston, Nelson would average 11.4 points, 5.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.3 steals, and 0.1 blocks, while only playing an average of 21.8 minutes per game, for a total of 872 games played for Boston. The numbers Nelson put up were quite tame, but what made him great can’t be determined by looking at a box score. Nelson was known for what has been named “the miracle shot”, which came during the 1969 NBA Finals between Boston and the Lakers (his former team). With just over a minute to spare in the game with the Celtics holding on to a 103-102 lead, Nelson shot a jumper from the foul-line that would hit the back of the rim, then bounced straight up several feet, before eventually dropping through the basket, which helped secure Boston’s 11th title in 13 seasons, and Nelson’s 3rd title with Boston. During his playing days, Nelson was also known to be an excellent defender and was known to be as tough as they come. Along with Nelson, the Celtics acquired additional role players Si Green, Ron Watts, and Woody Sauldsberry. The 6’2 point guard/shooting guard Si Green put up 3.2 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 0.9 assists per game in only a total of 10 games played for Boston on only 9.2 minutes per game. The 6’6 forward Ron Watts would be acquired through the 1965 NBA Draft as Boston selected him with the 9th pick in the 2nd round. Watts would play for Boston for two seasons and average 1.4 points, 1.4 rebounds, and 0.1 assists in 28 total games played for Boston and averaged 3.3 minutes per game. The 6’7 center/power forward Woody Sauldsberry would also be joining Boston this season. By this time, Woody was past his prime seasons and was now finding himself in a bench role on the Celtics roster as he averaged 4.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 0.4 assists in only 39 total games played for Boston while only playing 13.6 minutes per game.

                    The Celtics streak of championships would then be snapped in the 1966-67 season as they were eliminated by Wilt Chamberlain's 76ers in the Eastern Division Finals in only 5 games, who went on to win the NBA Championship. This season would be a massive adjustment period for Boston as their main coach, Red Auerbach, was moved to the position of the team executive. Filling that coach role would be Bill Russell, who made history becoming the first black player/coach in sports history. With Russell in his new role, Boston would have to adjust to such a change. The Celtics still finished with a 60-21 record, which placed them 2nd in the Eastern Division and 2nd in the whole league. Prior to the season's beginning, the Celtics would once again acquire more talent to their roster. The Celtics would take the 6’4 shooting guard/point guard Jim Barnett, with the 8th pick in the 1st round of the 1966 NBA Draft. Jim would be yet another role player who averaged 4.1 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 0.9 assists in only 48 total games played for Boston on only 8.0 minutes per game. The Celtics would also add the future Hall of Famer Wayne Embry, standing at only 6’8 at the center position. At this point in his career, Wayne was way past his prime with the Cincinnati Royals. Wayne would serve as a backup center and would mainly come off the bench. During the two seasons he spent in Boston, he played in a total of 150 games, while averaging 5.8 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 0.6 assists, on only 12.1 minutes per game. The Celtics would then add another future Hall of Famer to the roster, the 6’7 power forward/small forward Bailey Howell. Howell was already at the age of 30 by this point, but that didn’t alter his performance for the Celtics. During his time in Boston, Bailey put up 18.0 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 30.7 minutes per game, as he played at the starting power forward position. Bailey had quite the shoes to fill as he was replacing Celtic great Tom Heinsohn. But Bailey rose to that challenge and was a perfect fit with the Celtics in his starting role. Bailey was a player who could do a little bit of everything. He was a solid scorer, solid rebounder, and a great defender. Lastly, the Celtics acquired the 6’6 power forward Toby Kimball. Toby had actually been drafted by Boston with the 9th pick, in the 3rd round, of the 1965 NBA Draft, but decided to play in Italy. His actual debut season would be this season and as a rookie he put up tame numbers of 2.6 points, 3.8 rebounds, 0.3 assists in only 5.8 minutes per game as he played for a total of 38 games for the Celtics.

                    Once the 1967-68 season rolled around, the Celtics would have another tame year with the acquisitions to their roster. The Celtics picked up the 6’1 point guard, Mal Graham, with the 11th pick in the 1st round of the 1967 NBA Draft. Graham would be a role player, as he averaged only 12.7 minutes per game, playing in a total of 70 games for Boston (and his whole NBA career), while putting up 4.7 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 1.1 assists during his two seasons in Boston. Boston would also acquire the 6’7 small forward, Johnny Jones, another role player. Johnny averaged 4.2 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 0.5 assists, in only 51 total games played for Boston in only 9.3 minutes per game. The Celtics would then acquire two more 6’2 guards, Tom Thacker and Rick Weitzman. Thacker played both guard positions, while Weitzman only played the shooting guard position. Weitzman played in only 25 games for the Celtics (and his whole career) averaging 1.3 points, 0.4 rebounds, and 0.3 assists in only 3.0 minutes played per game. Thacker would also serve the role of coming off the bench, and played only 65 games for Boston. He would average 4.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.1 assists in only 12.0 minutes played per game.

                    Heading into the final season of the Celtics dynasty of the 60s (1968-69 season), the Celtics would once again make additions to their roster. Boston would draft the 6’5 shooting guard Don Chaney, with the 12th pick in the 1st round of the 1968 NBA Draft. Chaney would become a valuable member of the Celtic teams in the 70s, but during his rookie and sophomore seasons, he came off the bench. During his first two seasons in Boston, Chaney put up 4.7 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.1 assists in only 12.6 minutes played per game. Chaney was known to be an excellent defender who could guard his man fairly well. In the same 1968 NBA Draft, the Celtics would also select the 6’7 center/power forward, Rich Johnson, with the 10th pick in the 4th round. Johnson would spend three years with the Celtics and serve as a backup center, as he would average 4.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.4 assists in a total of 97 games played for Boston in only 11.1 minutes per game. The Celtics would also add the 6’8 power forward Bud Olsen through trades, but would then trade Olsen only 7 games into the regular season. In those 7 games, Olsen would come off the bench and put up averages of 2.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 0.6 assists in only 6.1 minutes played per game. The Celtics would then acquire the 6’1 point guard Em Bryant from New York. Bryant was a player who got a ton of minutes, even though he came off the bench as he averaged 6.7 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.7 assists in 151 total games played for Boston (2 seasons) in 19.9 minutes played per game. Lastly, the Celtics would add the 6’8 power forward/center Jim Barnes, after receiving him in a trade from Chicago. Barnes would go on to play 2 seasons with Boston as he averaged 5.6 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 0.6 assists in 126 total games played for Boston in only 13.0 minutes played per game, coming off the bench.

                    It goes without saying that the Boston Celtics ruled the Basketball world in the 60s. Bill Russell had one of the greatest careers most Basketball players could ever dream of having. Not only was he a phenomenal player, he was also a wonderful leader. He helped build the Boston Celtics into a dynasty that has forever been inscribed in the history books of the NBA. Without the leadership, skill, heart, intelligence, and hustle from Russell, the Celtics would be nowhere near the mountain top of the NBA’s rich history. Russell took every opportunity to learn the game and build upon his intelligence for it. Whenever players like Tim Duncan, Shaquille O’Neal, Kevin Garnett, etc wanted to learn and understand more about the game, they had guys like Bill Russell to go to. Whenever Bill Russell wanted to learn something, Bill Russell had only himself. Bill Russell will always be known as the man who changed how the game is played, a man who dominated a tough era of basketball, and a man who could lead his team to wins and who has the title of the greatest winner of American sports. To put Russell’s winning into perspective, consider this. Russell won 11 championships in 13 seasons, that means he won the championship 84.6% of the time in his career. If that is not enough to impress you, then consider this. Russell played in a total of 10 game 7’s in the NBA playoffs (5 of those game 7’s took place in the NBA Finals) and out of those 10 games, Bill Russell never lost once. He has a spotless 10-0 record in game 7’s. To add on to his amazing feat of winning, Russell achieved all this before his late 30s. Russell would retire after game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, which placed him at 35 years old. Russell could have possibly won a few more championships, bringing his total of championship rings to even more of an impossible amount to surpass. Considering all of Russell’s accolades and accomplishments, it’s no wonder why some people consider him to be the Greatest Player of All-Time.
