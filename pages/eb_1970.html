                    Popular players that were known drug abusers in the NBA include Michael Ray Richardson, David Thompson, Walter Davis, Bernard King, and many more.

                <h3>The NBA and ABA Merger Agreement</h3>
                <p>
                    On August 5th 1976, the ABA and NBA were were combined into one unified association, which basically saved the NBA's reputation. This agreement did cause a few problems though, such as a redraft for many of their teams. They also had to take in the new teams as well, which made things more complicated. Despite all the struggles, it was definitely worth it in the end, because this deal is the only reason the NBA exists as a corperate entity today.

                <h3>Tension Rising</h3>
                <p>
                    During the 1970's, there was a lot of racism between members of the NBA as black players were slowly becoming more dominant in the league. This, as well as a rise in substance abuse caused players to become much more physically aggressive towards each other, sometimes even assualting one another which didn't put a good look on the league. With their competitors, the ABA, gaining popularity and evolving basketball in new and innovative ways, and the NBA's image degrading, the NBA was backed into a corner and struggled to maintain an audience throughout a majority of the decade.

                <h3>Substance Abuse in the League</h3>
                <p>
                    Drug addiction in the NBA became more prevelent than it's ever been in the 1970's. Los Angeles Times estimated at least 40% to 75% of the league was addicted to some kind of drug, and 1 out of 10 players who weren't at least tried it in some way. Many players were using it as a stress reliever, but some were convinced that it actually made them better at the game. Since this was one of the main factors for a large majority of the fights breaking out, the NBA eventually put their foot down in the late 70's by creating strict policies against drug abuse, and treating addicted players through a multitude of rehabilitation programs. These treatments and the measures they'd go through would often scale with the severity of the player's addiction and what they're addicted to. These programs proved to be quite effective, and we'd see something of a renaissance going into the 1980's.

                <h3>How the ABA Changed Basketball</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides the disposal of the traditional orange basketball in favor of a red, white and blue basketball, the creation of the ABA led to the introduction of many new concepts, ideas and rules that would become mainstays of the sport. George Mikan of the NBA commissioned the first of many new ideas being the 3-point line. The 3-point line is an arch that's 20 feet and 6 inches away from each basket, or in other words, a line about a fourth of the court away from each basket. If you shot the ball from behind the 3-point line and managed to score, your team gains 3 points rather than the normal 2 you would have gotten if you shot closer. Soon after the ABA merged with the NBA, the distance was extended to 22 feet, but the basic idea remained the same. This new rule added an extra layer of risk and reward that made the sport more interesting to watch for fans of basketball, and added more depth for players. Something else introduced around this era was the Spencer Haywood Hardship Rule. Both the NBA and ABA required that a player must be 4 years removed from high school graduation to be eligible to join the league, however the ABA would offer an exemption on the basis of hardships. The NBA soon followed after a U.S. Supreme Court case where they ruled against the NBA's descision to forbid a basketball player named Spencer Haywood from being drafted into an NBA team due to him garduating high school less than 4 years ago. Haywood had troubles at home with his mother having to raise 10 children and work picking cotton for $2 per day, which led to the court overturning the NBA's decision. Moving on, another idea for basketball the ABA introduced was the Slam Dunk Contest, which was a concept proposed by Julius Erving, where during halftime, there would be a contest of 2 rounds between players where each would attempt a slam dunk on each other and judges would rate them depending on their performance. The NBA also adopted the Slam Dunk Contest after its success in the ABA. The Slam Dunk Contest caused tickets for their games to sell out very quickly, and was praised across the board as a new and innovative way to entertain viewers during halftime.
