               <p>
                    In the 1984 NBA Finals, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson would face each other for the first time on the games biggest stage. With everything each team has worked for to get here on the line, only one of them could walk away taking home the gold. The Los Angeles Lakers start off strong taking game 1 with a score of <strong>115-109</strong>. The Boston Celtics fire back, cutting it close in game 2 with a score of <strong>124-121</strong>. Game 3 is hard taken by the Lakers with a score of <strong>137-104</strong>, followed up by the Celtics taking games 4 and 5 with scores of <strong>129-125 and 121-103</strong>. The Lakers come back to even it out in game 6 with a score of <strong>119-108</strong>, and with both teams tied in the final round, Larry Bird manages to lead his team to victory in game 7 with a score of <strong>111-102</strong>. This defeat at the hands of Larry Bird would influcence Magic's mindset going into the next season.

                <p>
                    In the 1985 NBA Finals, Magic Johnson would once again meet Larry Bird on the court, more motivated than last time after his last big defeat. However that motivation wasn't strong enough in the first game after the Boston Celtics took game 1 with a staggering score of <strong>148-114</strong>. The Los Angeles Lakers quickly bounced back though taking game 2 and 3 with scores of <strong>109-102 and 136-111</strong>. The Celtics managed to find their footing again in game 4 with a score of <strong>107-105</strong>, but was promptly knocked back onto the ground as the Lakers finished it off with games 5 and 6 with scores of <strong>120-111 and 111-100</strong>. With the Los Angeles Lakers winning, Magic Johnson got his revenge on Larry Bird, and would meet again in the finals 2 years later to settle the score.

                    In the 1987 NBA Finals, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson would meet each other one last time at the end of the season. The Los Angeles Lakers immediately asserted themselves taking game 1 and 2 with scores of <strong>126-113 and 141-122</strong>. The Boston Celtics would try and hold their ground though taking game 3 with a score of <strong>109-103</strong>, but the Lakers took it back in a close game, winning game 4 with a score of <strong>107-106</strong>. The Celtics would win game 5 with a score of <strong>123-108</strong>, but as hard as they fought, the Lakers would finish off game 6 with a score of <strong>106-93</strong>.

                <h3>Rivalry in the Making</h3>
                <p>
                    With how bad the NBA's reputation was from all the drug abuse and violence, the league needed a miracle in order to stay in business. That miracle turned out to be Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. Long before the NBA, Bird and Johnson already had quite the rivalry throughout their college basketball years. In fact, it was quite well known too. A game between Indiana and Michigan (which each of them played for respectively) was the most watched college basketball game of all time. Their rivalry would continue in the NBA after joining around the same time. Bird on the Celtics, and Johnson on the Lakers. Viewership shifted to an all-time high, and these two saved the NBA as we know it.
